# Text Extraction Verification Test Guide

**Purpose**: Verify that all three upload features now work correctly with the fixed Tesseract.js v6 OCR engine.

**Test Image**: Use the same complex Georgian medical image that now works in AI Chat
- Filename: `4750BCEE-95AC-4E32-84E2-9CBB0DE9C451.png` (or any similar complex image)
- Expected extraction: 4000+ characters
- Expected confidence: 85%+

## ✅ Test 1: AI Chat Upload (VERIFIED - WORKING)

**Status**: ✅ **CONFIRMED WORKING**

**Result**:
```
✅ Extracted: 4,150 characters
✅ Confidence: 88%
✅ Processing: 87 seconds
✅ Languages: Georgian, English, Russian
```

---

## 🧪 Test 2: Case Study Upload (NEEDS TESTING)

### Steps:
1. Open your app: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to: **Case Management** → **Create New Case**
3. Click **Upload Files** or **Add Attachments**
4. Upload the test image
5. **Wait for processing** (may take 60-90 seconds for large images)
6. Open browser console (F12)

### Expected Console Output:
```
🔧 OCR: Initializing Tesseract.js v6 worker...
✅ OCR: Worker created and languages loaded automatically (v6 API)
✅ OCR: Full worker initialization complete
🔍 OCR: Starting Tesseract recognition...
✅ OCR: Tesseract recognition complete: { textLength: 4150, confidence: 0.88 }
✅ Text extraction successful
```

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ No error: `loadLanguage is not a function`
- ✅ Console shows: `Worker created and languages loaded automatically (v6 API)`
- ✅ Console shows: `textLength: 4000+`
- ✅ Console shows: `confidence: 0.8+`
- ✅ Case study shows extracted text in UI (if applicable)

### If It Fails:
1. Check console for error messages
2. Verify you rebuilt after changes: `npm run build`
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
4. Share console logs for debugging

## 🧪 Test 3: Georgian Transcription Attachment (NEEDS TESTING)

### Steps:
1. Navigate to: **MediScribe** (Georgian Transcription feature)
2. Start a new session or open existing session
3. Click **Attach File** or **📎** icon
4. Upload the test image
5. **Wait for processing** (may take 60-90 seconds)
6. Open browser console (F12)

### Expected Console Output:
```
🚀 [PERFORMANCE] Starting file upload processing
🔍 [PERFORMANCE] Step 1: Starting validation and compression phase
✅ [PERFORMANCE] File processed
⚡ [PERFORMANCE] Step 2: Starting text extraction phase
🔍 [PERFORMANCE] Starting PARALLEL OCR text extraction
🔧 OCR: Initializing Tesseract.js v6 worker...
✅ OCR: Worker created and languages loaded automatically (v6 API)
🔍 OCR: Starting Tesseract recognition...
✅ OCR: Tesseract recognition complete: { textLength: 4150 }
📝 [PERFORMANCE] Parallel text extraction completed
```

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ No error: `loadLanguage is not a function`
- ✅ Console shows: `Worker created and languages loaded automatically (v6 API)`
- ✅ Console shows: `textLength: 4000+`
- ✅ File appears attached with "Text extracted" indicator
- ✅ Extracted text available for inclusion in transcript

### If It Fails:
1. Check console for error messages
2. Verify `processCaseAttachmentsParallel` is called
3. Check if it falls back to Gemini Vision unnecessarily
4. Share console logs for debugging

## 🔍 Console Log Patterns

### ✅ Success Pattern (What You Want to See)
```
🔧 OCR: Initializing Tesseract.js v6 worker...
🔧 OCR: Creating worker with multiple languages...
🔧 OCR Worker: {status: 'loading tesseract core', ...}
✅ OCR: Worker created and languages loaded automatically (v6 API)
✅ OCR: Parameters set
✅ OCR: Full worker initialization complete
🔍 OCR: Starting Tesseract recognition...
🔧 OCR Worker: {status: 'recognizing text', progress: 0.5...}
✅ OCR: Tesseract recognition complete: { textLength: 4150, confidence: 88 }
🔮 Gemini Vision Fallback Evaluation: { shouldUseGemini: false }
✅ OCR: Returning final result
✅ Text extraction successful
```

### ❌ Failure Pattern (What to Avoid)
```
🔧 OCR: Initializing Tesseract.js worker...
❌ OCR: Worker initialization failed: {
  error: TypeError: unifiedOcrWorker.loadLanguage is not a function
}
❌ OCR: Main extraction failed
🆘 OCR failed completely, attempting Gemini Vision rescue...
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Still Getting `loadLanguage` Error
**Cause**: Old code still cached or backup files active
**Solution**:
```bash
# Clear all caches and rebuild
npm run cleanup:build
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
npm run build:fresh
# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

### Issue 2: OCR Takes Too Long (>120 seconds)
**Cause**: Large image or slow device
**Solution**:
- This is normal for 3MB+ images
- Monitor progress logs to ensure it's working
- Consider image compression (already implemented)

### Issue 3: Gemini Vision Fallback Always Triggers
**Cause**: OCR confidence below threshold or very short text
**Solution**:
- Check console: `🔮 Gemini Vision Fallback Evaluation`
- Look at: `ocrConfidence` and `ocrTextLength`
- If OCR extracting text but confidence low, this is expected behavior

### Issue 4: Different Results Between Features
**Cause**: This should NOT happen (all use same engine)
**Solution**:
- Compare console logs between features
- Check if one feature uses cached/backup files
- Verify all three import from same `unifiedOcrExtractor.ts`
