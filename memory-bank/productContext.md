# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

MediMind Expert exists to revolutionize how doctors access and interact with medical knowledge. The current healthcare landscape suffers from information fragmentation, where critical medical literature, guidelines, and patient case insights are scattered across multiple sources, making it time-consuming for doctors to find reliable, up-to-date information during patient care.

## Problems It Solves

- **Information Overload**: Doctors struggle to quickly find relevant, specialty-specific medical information
- **Knowledge Fragmentation**: Medical guidelines, literature, and personal resources are scattered across different platforms
- **Limited Contextual AI**: Existing AI tools lack medical specialty context and access to curated medical knowledge
- **Inefficient Case Discussions**: No centralized platform for AI-assisted case analysis with contextual medical knowledge
- **Manual Calculations**: Time-consuming manual medical calculations that could be automated

## How It Should Work

The platform provides specialty-specific workspaces (initially Cardiology and OB/GYN) where doctors can:
1. **Onboard with specialty selection** - ensuring personalized experience from day one
2. **Access AI Co-Pilot** - contextual medical discussions powered by Flowise API integration
3. **Manage patient cases** - create, discuss, and analyze cases with AI assistance
4. **Utilize medical calculators** - specialty-specific tools for quick clinical calculations
5. **Access knowledge bases** - both curated medical literature and personal document repositories
6. **Upload and reference files** - integrate personal medical resources for AI-enhanced discussions

## User Experience Goals

- **Speed**: Rapid access to medical information and calculations
- **Accuracy**: Reliable, evidence-based responses from curated medical sources
- **Personalization**: Specialty-specific content and tools tailored to individual practice
- **Integration**: Seamless workflow integration with existing medical practice
- **Trust**: Transparent source referencing and reliable medical information
- **Accessibility**: Intuitive interface designed for busy medical professionals
