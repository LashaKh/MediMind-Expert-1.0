## Core Requirements and Goals

- Develop and launch an MVP of MediMind AI Co-Pilot for doctors within 2 months.
- Provide rapid, reliable access to curated, up-to-date medical literature, guidelines, and treatment plans, specific to chosen medical specialty (Cardiology, OB/GYN for MVP).
- Integrate with pre-existing AI backend (Flowise and Zep) via API for contextual case discussions and knowledge retrieval.
- Enable doctors to manage a personal knowledge base by uploading their own trusted resources.
- Include specialty-specific medical calculators and forms.

- Fillable forms (view/download only)
- Advanced search/navigation, notifications, and feedback mechanisms (post-MVP)
- Mobile document upload (web-only for MVP)
