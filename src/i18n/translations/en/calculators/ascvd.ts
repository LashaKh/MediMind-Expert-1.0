  // Clinical recommendations
  recommendation_low: "Focus on lifestyle modifications including heart-healthy diet, regular physical activity, and smoking cessation if applicable. Reassess risk factors in 4-6 years.",
  recommendation_intermediate: "Consider moderate-intensity statin therapy after risk-benefit discussion. Emphasize lifestyle modifications. May benefit from coronary artery calcium scoring for further risk stratification.",
  recommendation_high: "High-intensity statin therapy recommended. Consider blood pressure optimization and aspirin therapy based on bleeding risk assessment. Intensive lifestyle modifications essential.",

  // Facts and figures

  // Clinical pearls
  clinical_pearls_title: "Clinical Pearls & Pitfalls",
  clinical_pearl_1: "The calculator may overestimate risk in some populations (e.g., higher socioeconomic status) and underestimate in others (e.g., South Asian ancestry).",
  clinical_pearl_2: "For patients with borderline or intermediate risk, consider risk-enhancing factors: family history of premature ASCVD, persistent LDL ≥160 mg/dL, chronic kidney disease, metabolic syndrome, chronic inflammatory conditions, premature menopause, preeclampsia, and South Asian ancestry.",
  clinical_pearl_3: "Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring can help reclassify intermediate-risk patients. CAC = 0 suggests lower risk and may defer statin therapy in select patients.",
  // Formula
  formula_title: "Formula",
  formula_description: "The ASCVD Risk Calculator uses the Pooled Cohort Equations, which incorporate age, sex, race, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, blood pressure treatment, diabetes, and smoking status.",
