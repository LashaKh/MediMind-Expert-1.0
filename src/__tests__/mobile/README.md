## Testing Requirements

### TDD Approach
- All tests MUST be written first and MUST fail before implementation
- Tests validate the contract APIs defined in `/specs/001-mobile-first-mediscribe/contracts/`
- Medical safety requirements must be enforced

### Mobile Standards
- Touch targets: minimum 44px (Apple guidelines)
- Layout transitions: <100ms performance requirement
- Input latency: <50ms during text editing
- Animation smoothness: 60fps maintenance

### Accessibility Compliance
- WCAG 2.1 AA standards for medical professionals
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Touch target accessibility

### Browser Compatibility
- iOS Safari
- Chrome Mobile  
- Samsung Internet
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Usage

Import mobile testing utilities:

```typescript
import { 
  MOBILE_VIEWPORTS,
  PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLDS,
  simulateViewportChange,
  simulateKeyboard,
  measurePerformance,
  checkTouchTargetSize,
  checkAccessibility
} from './setup'
```

## Performance Validation

All mobile optimizations must meet:
- PR-001: Layout transitions complete within 100ms
- PR-002: Input latency under 50ms during text editing  
- PR-003: 60fps animation smoothness maintained

## Medical Workflow Preservation

- Recording functionality uninterrupted during layout changes
- Session state preserved across keyboard interactions
- Medical transcript content never lost during viewport transitions
- Medical professional workflow continuity maintained
