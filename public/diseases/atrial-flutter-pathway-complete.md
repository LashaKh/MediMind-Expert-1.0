# Atrial Flutter 

## Background

### Overview

#### **Definition**
Atrial flutter is a supraventricular arrhythmia characterized by rapid, regular atrial contractions, primarily confined to the right atrium.

#### **Pathophysiology**
The pathophysiology of atrial flutter involves the formation of a reentrant circuit, often around the tricuspid valve or along the right atrial wall. This circuit results in a rapid and regular atrial rhythm. Abnormal intraatrial conduction, slow conduction paths, and areas of low voltage in the atria can contribute to the initiation and maintenance of these reentrant circuits.

#### **Epidemiology**
The prevalence of idiopathic neonatal atrial flutter in Europe is estimated at 1.5 per 100,000 population.

#### **Risk factors**
Risk factors for atrial flutter include advancing age (particularly prevalent in the elderly population) and underlying cardiac conditions such as hypertension, HF, and congenital heart disease. Additional risk factors include pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism, and the use of specific medications, such as class 1C antiarrhythmic drugs.

#### **Disease course**
The clinical features of atrial flutter often include palpitations, dyspnea, and chest discomfort. However, the diagnosis is often confirmed through a 12-lead ECG or an electrophysiology study and mapping. Complications can include stroke, HF, thromboembolism, and progression to AF.

#### **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**
The prognosis of atrial flutter can be influenced by several factors. The presence of underlying heart disease can complicate the condition and lead to poorer outcomes. There is a risk of progression to AF.

## Guidelines

### Key sources
The following summarized guidelines for the evaluation and management of atrial flutter are prepared by our editorial team based on guidelines from the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP 2024), the American Heart Association (AHA/HRS/ACC/ACCP 2024), the European Society of Cardiology (ESC/EACTS 2024,2021), the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS/CHRS 2020), the European Society of Cardiology (ESC 2020,2018), the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS 2018), the Latin American Heart Rhythm Society (SOLAECE/ECAS/APHRS/EHRA/HRS 2017), and the American Heart Association (AHA/HRS/ACC 2016).

## Clinical Findings

### Symptoms
- Chest pain
- Dizziness
- Dyspnea
- Palpitations
- Syncope

### Medication history
- Antiarrhythmic agents

### Past medical history
- COPD
- Congenital heart disease

## Diagnostic Investigations

### Evaluation of palpitations
As per AAFP 2024 guidelines:
- Obtain a 12-lead ECG as part of the initial evaluation of patients with palpitations to screen for structural and ischemic heart disease, conduction disorders, and arrhythmias. Recognize that ambulatory ECG monitoring for 2 weeks has the highest diagnostic yield-to-cost ratio in the evaluation of palpitations of unknown etiology. (B)
- Obtain echocardiography if history, physical examination, or ECG results raise concern for structural heart disease. (B)
- Transfer patients experiencing palpitations in the presence of hemodynamic instability, syncope, ischemic chest pain, signs of HF, or ischemic or syndromic ECG changes to the emergency department with immediate cardiology referral. (B)
- Recognize that the use of smartphone-based ambulatory cardiac monitoring devices is highly diagnostic for AF, the most common arrhythmia causing palpitations, but other forms of arrhythmia detection are less clear. (B)

## Medical Management

### Rate control, acute:

- Consider administering IV amiodarone for acute rate control (in the absence of pre-excitation) in patients with atrial flutter and systolic HF, if β-blockers are contraindicated or ineffective. (C)

### Rate control, long-term
As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2016 guidelines, initiate β-blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil to control the ventricular rate in patients with hemodynamically tolerated atrial flutter. (B)

- Consider performing atrial pacing to decrease recurrences of atrial flutter in adult patients with congenital heart disease and SND. (C)

### Catheter ablation:
**As per ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines:**

As per ESC 2020 guidelines, Consider performing atrioventricular nodal ablation with subsequent pacing ("ablate and pace"), either biventricular or His-bundle pacing, if catheter ablation and pharmacological rhythm control fail and the patient has symptomatic persistent macroreentrant atrial arrhythmia with fast ventricular rates. (C)

## Perioperative Care

### Pericardioversion anticoagulation:
**As per ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines:**
- Initiate anticoagulant therapy in patients with atrial flutter according to the same risk profile used for AF. (B)
- Continue anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks after successful cardioversion or ablation resulting in restoration of sinus rhythm in patients with atrial flutter. (B)
- Initiate ongoing oral anticoagulation as indicated for AF after successful cavotricuspid isthmus ablation in patients with typical atrial flutter with a history of AF previously detected before atrial flutter ablation. (A)
- Obtain close follow-up and arrhythmia monitoring to detect silent AF after successful cavotricuspid isthmus ablation in patients with typical atrial flutter deemed to be at high thromboembolic risk without any known previous history of AF if they are not receiving ongoing anticoagulation in view of significant risk of AF. (B)
- Consider initiating long-term anticoagulation after successful cavotricuspid isthmus ablation in patients with typical atrial flutter without any known previous history of AF at high risk for development of AF (such as left atrium enlargement, inducible AF, COPD, HF) if thromboembolic risk assessment suggests high risk (> 2% annual risk) for stroke. (C)

**As per EACTS/ESC 2021 guidelines:**
- Administer effective anticoagulation for a minimum of 3 weeks before cardioversion of atrial flutter. (B)
- Initiate effective anticoagulation as soon as possible before every cardioversion of atrial flutter. (B)
- Consider administering anticoagulation before cardioversion (using heparin, a factor Xa inhibitor, or a direct thrombin inhibitor) in patients with atrial flutter of < 48 hours duration and a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 in males and 1 in females, without the need for postcardioversion oral anticoagulation. (C)
- Consider obtaining a TEE before cardioversion in patients with atrial flutter of ≥ 48 hours or of unknown duration who have not received anticoagulation for the preceding 3 weeks. Perform cardioversion if no LA thrombus is identified, including in the LAA, provided that anticoagulation is achieved before TEE and maintained after cardioversion for at least 4 weeks. (C)

**As per CCS 2018 guidelines:**
- Initiate therapeutic anticoagulation, in addition to appropriate rate control, for 3 weeks before cardioversion in most hemodynamically stable patients with atrial flutter planned to undergo electrical or pharmacological cardioversion. (B)
- Consider obtaining a TEE to exclude cardiac thrombus as an alternative to at least 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation before cardioversion. (C)
- Consider initiating immediate (preferably before cardioversion) therapeutic anticoagulation with either a DOAC or with heparin followed by adjusted-dose warfarin when a decision is made that the patient will be undergoing unplanned cardioversion of atrial flutter. (C)
- Consider administering at least 4 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation (adjusted-dose warfarin or a DOAC, in the absence of a strong contraindication) in all patients after cardioversion of atrial flutter. (C)
- Decide on the need for ongoing antithrombotic therapy based on the risk of stroke. (B)
