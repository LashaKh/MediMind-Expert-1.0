### Patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic VT, evaluation
As per ESC 2022 guidelines:
- Diagnose catecholaminergic polymorphic VT in the presence of a structurally normal heart, normal ECG, and exercise- or emotion-induced bidirectional or polymorphic VT. (B)
- Diagnose catecholaminergic polymorphic VT in patients carrying a mutation in disease-causing genes. (B)
- Obtain genetic testing and provide genetic counseling in patients with clinical suspicion or clinical diagnosis of catecholaminergic polymorphic VT. (B)
- Consider obtaining epinephrine or isoproterenol challenge testing for the diagnosis of catecholaminergic polymorphic VT when an exercise test is not possible. (C)
- Do not Performprogrammed electrical stimulation for stratification of SCD risk. (D)

As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines:
- Consider providing genetic counseling and obtaining genetic testing in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic VT and clinical VT or exertional syncope. (C)
- Provide genetic counseling and Obtain mutation-specific genetic testing in first-degree relatives of patients having a causative mutation for catecholaminergic polymorphic VT. (B)
- Do not Obtain electrophysiologic testing for risk stratification for VA in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic VT. (D)

### Patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic VT, management
As per ESC 2022 guidelines:
- Discourage participation in competitive sports, strenuous exercise, and exposure to stressful environments in all patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic VT. (B)
- Initiate  β-blockers, ideally nonselective (nadolol or propranolol), in all patients with a clinical diagnosis of catecholaminergic polymorphic VT. (B)
- PerformICD placement combined with β-blockers and flecainide in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic VT after aborted cardiac arrest. (B)
- Consider init

- Consider initiating β-blockers in patients with genetically positive catecholaminergic polymorphic VT without phenotype. (C)
- Consider performing left cardiac sympathetic denervation in patients with a diagnosis of catecholaminergic polymorphic VT when the combination of β-blockers and flecainide at therapeutic dosage is either not effective, not tolerated, or contraindicated. (C)
- Consider performing ICD placement in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic VT experiencing arrhythmogenic syncope and/or documented bidirectional/polymorphic VT while on the highest tolerated β-blocker dose and on flecainide. (C)
- Consider initiating flecainide in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic VT experiencing recurrent syncope, polymorphic/bidirectional VT, or persistent exertional premature ventricular complexes while on β-blockers at the highest tolerated dose. (C)

As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines:
- Initiate  β-blockers in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic VT. (B)
- Initiate  combination medical therapy (such as β-blockers, flecainide), Performleft cardiac sympathetic denervation, and/or an ICD placement for treatment intensification in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic VT and recurrent sustained VT or syncope while receiving adequate or maximally tolerated β-blocker therapy. (B)
- Consider performing ICD placement in patients with a cardiac channelopathy survived sudden cardiac arrest, if the expected meaningful survival is > 1 year. (B)

## Quality improvement

### Public access defibrillation
As per ESC 2022 guidelines:
- Ensure public access defibrillation is available at sites where cardiac arrest is more likely to occur. (B)
- Promote community training in basic life support to increase bystander CPR rate and automated external defibrillator use. (B)
