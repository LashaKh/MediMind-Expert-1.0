**AATS/STS 2022 guidelines**: Ensure a stepwise approach to the evaluation and treatment of patients with acute/subacute uncomplicated type B aortic dissection, including identification of the primary entry tear site location, defining the proximity and distance of the dissection to the left subclavian artery, calibration of the maximum orthogonal aortic diameter, and confirmation of the lack of any organ malperfusion or other indications of complicated disease. (B)

**ACEP 2015 guidelines**: Do not use existing clinical decision rules alone in an attempt to identify patients at very low risk for acute nontraumatic thoracic aortic dissection. Ensure that the decision to pursue further workup for acute nontraumatic aortic dissection is at the discretion of the treating physician. (D)

As per AATS/ACC/ACR/.../SVM 2010 guidelines:
- Consider obtaining a routine evaluation of any patient presenting with complaints possibly representing acute thoracic aortic dissection to establish a pretest risk of disease that can then be used to guide diagnostic decisions.

(B)
- Elicit a history of recent aortic manipulation (surgical or catheter-based) or a known history of aortic valvular disease in patients presenting with sudden onset of severe chest, back, and/or abdominal pain, as these factors predispose to acute aortic dissection. (B)

### ECG:
As per AATS/ACC/ACR/.../SVM 2010 guidelines: Obtain an ECG in all patients presenting with symptoms possibly representing acute thoracic aortic dissection.
