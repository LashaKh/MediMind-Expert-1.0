## Screening and Diagnosis

### Diagnostic Criteria
As per ESC 2019 guidelines: Use validated diagnostic criteria in patients with suspected PE without hemodynamic instability.  (A)

## Classification and Risk Stratification

### Risk Stratification
As per ESC 2019 guidelines:

- **Stratify patients with suspected or confirmed PE**, based on the presence of hemodynamic instability, to identify patients at high risk of early mortality.  (A)

- **Stratify patients with PE and without hemodynamic instability** further into intermediate- and low-risk categories.  (A)

- **Use clinical probability**, based on either clinical judgment or a validated prediction rule, to guide the diagnostic strategy.  (A)

## Diagnostic Investigations

### History and Physical Examination
As per AAFP 2017 guidelines:

- **Elicit a thorough history and perform a physical examination** to diagnose or exclude life-threatening causes of pleuritic chest pain.  (B)

- **Suspect PE in all patients with pleuritic chest pain**, as it is the most common life-threatening cause of this symptom. Use a validated clinical decision rule to guide the use of additional tests, including D-dimer and imaging.  (B)

### D-dimer Testing
As per ESC 2019 guidelines:

- **Obtain D-dimer testing**, preferably with a highly sensitive assay, in outpatients/emergency department patients with low or intermediate clinical probability or if PE is unlikely.  (A)

- **Do not obtain D-dimer testing** in patients with high clinical probability, as a normal result does not safely exclude PE. (D)

### Diagnostic Imaging
As per ESC 2019 guidelines:

- **Confirm the diagnosis of VTE** if compression ultrasound shows a proximal DVT in a patient with clinical suspicion of PE.  (A)

- **Obtain bedside echocardiography or emergency CTPA** (depending on availability and clinical circumstances) for the diagnosis of patients with suspected high-risk PE.  (A)

- **Confirm the diagnosis of PE** if CTPA shows a segmental or more proximal filling defect in a patient with intermediate or high clinical probability.  (A)

- **Reject the diagnosis of PE without further testing** if CTPA is normal in a patient with low or intermediate clinical probability or if PE is unlikely.  (A)

- **Do not obtain CTV as an adjunct to CTPA.** (D)

- **Do not obtain MRA to rule out PE.** (D)

- **Reject the diagnosis of PE without further testing** if the V/Q lung scan is normal.  (A)

- **Obtain routine reevaluation after 3-6 months** in patients with acute PE.  (A)

### Transition of Care
As per ESC 2019 guidelines: **Implement an integrated model of care after acute PE**, in order to ensure optimal transition from hospital to ambulatory care.  (A)

### Management of Recurrent PE

**As per ASH 2020 guidelines:**

- **Consider administering LMWH over DOAC therapy** in patients with breakthrough DVT and/or PE during therapeutic VKA treatment. (C)

- **Continue indefinite antithrombotic therapy over stopping anticoagulation** after completion of primary treatment in patients with a recurrent unprovoked DVT and/or PE.  (B)

**As per ESC 2019 guidelines:**
- **Continue OAC therapy indefinitely** in patients presenting with recurrent VTE (at least 1 previous episode of PE or DVT) not related to a major transient or reversible risk factor.  (A)

**As per ACCP 2016 guidelines:**
- **Consider switching to treatment with LMWH** at least temporarily in patients who have recurrent VTE on OACs and are believed to be compliant. (C)
