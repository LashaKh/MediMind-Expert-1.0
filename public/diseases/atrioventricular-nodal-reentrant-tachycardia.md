# Atrioventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia (AVNRT)


## Background

### Overview

#### **Definition**
AVNRT is a type of SVT characterized by a reentry circuit within the atrioventricular node.

#### **Pathophysiology**
The pathophysiology of AVNRT involves dual pathways within the atrioventricular node, typically referred to as the fast and slow pathways. These dual pathways create a reentry circuit, leading to the abnormal electrical signals and rapid HR characteristic of this condition.

#### **Epidemiology**
The incidence of AVNRT in patients receiving ICDs is estimated at 3.5%.

#### **Risk factors**
Risk factors for AVNRT include female sex and structural heart disease. Certain triggers, such as stress or caffeine, can also precipitate episodes of AVNRT. Additionally, genetic predisposition may play a role in the development of AVNRT.

#### **Disease course**
Clinically, AVNRT often presents with symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, and shortness of breath. The duration and frequency of AVNRT episodes can vary widely among patients, with some experiencing infrequent, short-lived episodes and others suffering from more persistent or recurrent tachycardia.

#### **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**
The prognosis of AVNRT is generally good. It is a benign condition but can lead to significant morbidity due to the symptoms it causes.

## Guidelines

### Key sources
The following summarized guidelines for the management of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia are prepared by our editorial team based on guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC 2020) and the American Heart Association (AHA/HRS/ACC 2016).

## Clinical Findings

### Symptoms
- Chest pain
- Dizziness
- Dyspnea
- Fatigue
- Lightheadedness
- Palpitations
- Polyuria
- Pounding in the chest, neck, or ears
- Syncope

### Integument exam
- Diaphoresis

### Vital signs
- Tachycardia

## Medical Management

### Acute management

**As per ESC 2020 guidelines:**
- Administer IV adenosine (6-18 mg bolus) for acute management of hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT if vagal maneuvers fail. (B)
- Consider administering IV formulations of the following medications for acute management of hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT if vagal maneuvers and adenosine fail:
  - nondihydropyridine CCBs, i.e. verapamil or diltiazem
  - β-blockers, i.e. esmolol or metoprolol (C)

**As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2016 guidelines:**
- Administer adenosine for acute management of patients with AVNRT. (B)
- Consider administering β-blockers, diltiazem, verapamil for acute management of hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT, either formulated as IV (C) or PO. (C)
- Consider administering IV amiodarone for acute management of hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT when other therapies are ineffective or contraindicated. (C)

### Ongoing management

**As per ESC 2020 guidelines:**
- Consider initiating the following medications for the management of patients with AVNRT if ablation is not desirable or feasible:
  - nondihydropyridine CCBs (verapamil or diltiazem) in the absence of HFrEF
  - β-blockers (C)
- Consider offering abstinence from therapy in minimally symptomatic patients with very infrequent, short-lived episodes of AVNRT. (C)

**As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2016 guidelines:**
- Initiate oral formulations of the following medications for ongoing management of patients with AVNRT not being candidates for, or preferring not to undergo, catheter ablation:
  - verapamil
  - diltiazem
  - β-blockers (B)
- Consider initiating the following medications for ongoing management of patients without structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease having AVNRT and not being candidates for, or preferring not to undergo, catheter ablation and if β-blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil are ineffective or contraindicated:
  - flecainide
  - propafenone (C)
- Consider initiating oral formulations of the following medications for ongoing management of patients with AVNRT not being candidates for, or preferring not to undergo, catheter ablation:
  - sotalol
  - dofetilide
  - digoxin
  - amiodarone (C)
- Consider prescribing self-administration ("pill-in-the-pocket") of acute doses of oral β-blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil for ongoing management of patients with infrequent, well-tolerated episodes of AVNRT. (C)

## Nonpharmacologic Interventions

### Vagal maneuvers
- **As per ESC 2020 guidelines:** Perform vagal maneuvers, preferably in the supine position with leg elevation, for acute management of hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT. (B)
- **As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2016 guidelines:** Perform vagal maneuvers for acute management of patients with AVNRT. (B)

## Therapeutic Procedures

### Synchronized electrical cardioversion

**As per ESC 2020 guidelines:**
- Perform synchronized direct current cardioversion for acute management of hemodynamically unstable patients with AVNRT. (B)
- Perform synchronized direct current cardioversion for acute management of hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT if drug therapy fails to convert or control the tachycardia. (B)

**As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2016 guidelines:**
- Perform synchronized cardioversion for acute management of hemodynamically unstable patients with AVNRT if adenosine and vagal maneuvers do not terminate the tachycardia or are not feasible. (B)
- Perform synchronized cardioversion for acute management of hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT if pharmacological therapy does not terminate the tachycardia or is contraindicated. (B)

### Catheter ablation

**As per ESC 2020 guidelines:** Perform catheter ablation for the management of patients with symptomatic recurrent AVNRT. (B)

**As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2016 guidelines:** Perform catheter ablation of the slow pathway in patients with AVNRT. (B)

## Follow-up and Surveillance

### Follow-up
As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2016 guidelines, consider obtaining clinical follow-up without pharmacological therapy or ablation for ongoing management of minimally symptomatic patients with AVNRT. (C)
