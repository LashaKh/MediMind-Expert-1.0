# Traumatic Thoracic Aortic Injury


## What's New

The European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) has released new guidelines for the management of vascular trauma, including blunt thoracic aortic injury. For ESVS grade 1 injury (partial wall injury with normal external wall contour), nonoperative management with blood pressure control and follow-up imaging is recommended, with endovascular stent graft repair (EVAR) reserved for patients with concomitant severe traumatic brain injury when blood pressure control is not feasible. For ESVS grade 2 injury (external wall contour abnormality), delayed EVAR (≥24 hours) is suggested in the absence of high-risk features, while urgent EVAR (<24 hours) is recommended when high-risk features are present. For ESVS grade 3 injury (active extravasation), immediate operative repair is recommended. Stent graft oversizing (20-30%, depending on the hypovolemic status during index CTA) is suggested for emergency endovascular treatment. Active distal aortic perfusion is recommended during open surgical repair to reduce the risk of paraplegia.
