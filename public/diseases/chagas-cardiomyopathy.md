# Chagas Cardiomyopathy

## Background


### Overview

Chagas cardiomyopathy is a form of dilated cardiomyopathy caused by chronic infection with *Trypanosoma cruzi*, representing the most serious manifestation of chronic Chagas disease. It is characterized by progressive myocardial damage, arrhythmias, heart failure, and increased risk of sudden cardiac death.


## Guidelines

### Key Sources

The following summarized guidelines for the evaluation and management of Chagas cardiomyopathy are prepared by our editorial team based on guidelines from:

- **European Society of Cardiology (ESC 2022)**
- **Brazilian Society of Cardiology (BSC/ASE 2018)** 
- **American Heart Association (AHA/HRS/ACC 2013)**
- **Brazilian Society of Cardiology (BSC 2011)**

## Clinical Findings

### Symptoms
- Chest pain

### Vital Signs
- Bradycardia

### Past Medical History
- Dilated cardiomyopathy
- Heart failure (HF)
- Stroke

## Studies

### 2024 • CHAGASICS Study
In patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy at moderate-to-high risk of death and at least 1 episode of nonsustained VT, ICD was not superior to amiodarone with respect to death from all causes.

## Diagnostic Investigations

### ECG
**As per ASE/BSC 2018 guidelines:**
- Obtain an ECG in the initial evaluation to exclude conduction abnormalities (right bundle branch, left anterior fascicular, and AV block) and arrhythmias in all patients with newly diagnosed Chagas disease. (E)
- Consider obtaining follow-up ECGs at least every 2-5 years in patients with Chagas disease with the indeterminate form. (E)

**As per BSC 2011 guidelines:**
- Obtain a 12-lead ECG for periodic assessment of patients with Chagas disease. (B)
- Obtain dynamic ECG (Holter) for evaluation of arrhythmias and prognostic stratification of patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy. (B)

### Echocardiography

**As per ASE/BSC 2018 guidelines:**
- Obtain echocardiography in patients with suspected acute Chagas disease. (E)
- Obtain echocardiography in the initial evaluation to exclude LV dysfunction and aneurysms in all patients with newly diagnosed Chagas disease. (E)
- Assess ejection fraction and wall motion abnormalities as acute myocarditis is a common cardiac presentation. (E)
- Obtain echocardiography if any changes in ECG findings or clinical condition suggest possible HF. (E)

**Include the following in the imaging report in patients at stage B or higher:**
- LVEF
- Regional wall motion abnormalities and aneurysms
- LV diastolic function
- RV function
- Mitral and tricuspid regurgitation
- Pulmonary artery systolic pressure
- Presence of intracardiac thrombus
- Myocardial edema or fibrosis (E)

**Imaging Goals:**
- Set imaging goals of identifying the substrate for HF, thromboembolism, and malignant arrhythmias such as the presence of LV dysfunction, LV aneurysms or thrombus, myocardial fibrosis or inflammation, and regional sympathetic denervation. (E)

**Follow-up Imaging:**
- Obtain follow-up echocardiography (and/or cardiac MRI) for monitoring of cardiac structure and function at least yearly in patients at stage B or higher to provide important prognostic information and assist in making therapeutic decisions. (E)

**As per BSC 2011 guidelines:**
- Obtain Doppler echocardiography for additional diagnostic and prognostic assessment of patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy. (B)
- Obtain Doppler echocardiography to evaluate patients with the indeterminate form. (B)

### Advanced Cardiac Imaging
**As per ASE/BSC 2018 guidelines:**
- Do not obtain advanced imaging modalities (such as strain imaging or cardiac MRI) to detect silent myocardial damage in the indeterminate stage. (D)
- Consider obtaining cardiac MRI as an alternative modality to achieve imaging identification goals. Consider obtaining nuclear angiography for the evaluation of LV and RV function, and nuclear scintigraphy to detect myocardial perfusion defects, fibrosis, or denervation. (E)

**As per BSC 2011 guidelines:**
- Obtain cardiopulmonary stress testing for functional assessment, risk stratification, and support in the indication of cardiac transplantation in patients with advanced HF. (B)

### Chest Radiography
**As per BSC 2011 guidelines:**
- Obtain chest radiography for periodic diagnostic assessment of patients with Chagas disease. (B)

## Medical Management

### Management of Heart Failure
**As per Pathway 2025 guidelines:**
- Manage HF in patients with Chagas-related heart disease according to current published guidelines on HF. (E)

### Management of Ventricular Arrhythmia
**As per Pathway 2025 guidelines:**
- Manage ventricular arrhythmias in patients with Chagas-related heart disease according to current published guidelines on ventricular arrhythmias. (E)

**As per ESC 2022 guidelines:**
- Consider initiating amiodarone to reduce the arrhythmia burden in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy presenting with symptomatic premature ventricular complexes or VT. (C)

### Anticoagulation Therapy
**As per Pathway 2025 guidelines:**
- Initiate anticoagulation therapy for AF in patients with Chagas-related heart disease according to current published guidelines on thromboprophylaxis in AF. (E)

## Therapeutic Procedures

### Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD)
**As per ESC 2022 guidelines:**
- Consider placing an ICD in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy and symptomatic VT, if antiarrhythmic drugs (amiodarone and β-blockers) are ineffective or not tolerated. (C)

**As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2013 guidelines:**
- Consider placing an ICD in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy. (C)

### Catheter Ablation
**As per ESC 2022 guidelines:**
- Consider performing catheter ablation in specialized centers in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy and recurrent, symptomatic sustained monomorphic VT or ICD shocks for sustained monomorphic VT, if antiarrhythmic drugs are ineffective, contraindicated, or not tolerated. (C)
