# Aortic Regurgitation

## Background

### Overview

#### **Definition**
AR, also known as aortic insufficiency, is a structural heart disease characterized by diastolic flow of blood across the aortic valve, from the aorta into the left ventricle. ¹

#### **Pathophysiology**
AR may be due to malfunction of the valve leaflets themselves, dilatation of the aortic root and annulus, or a combination of these factors. ²

#### **Epidemiology**
The prevalence of AR in the US is estimated at 500 persons per 100,000 population. ³

#### **Disease course**
Chronic AR causes volume overload of the left ventricle, with ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction, and clinical symptoms of HF. Acute AR results in acute HF, and can progress to cardiogenic shock due to an uncompensated decrease in effective stroke volume. ²

#### **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**
Moderate or severe AR is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In highly symptomatic patients (NYHA functional class 3-4), annual mortality rates of approximately 25% have been reported. ⁴

## Diagnostic Investigations

### TTE
As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines:

- Obtain TTE for assessment of the cause and severity of regurgitation, LV size and systolic function, prognosis, and timing of valve intervention in patients with signs and symptoms of AR. (B)

- Obtain TTE for evaluation of the presence and severity of AR in patients with bicuspid aortic valve or with known dilation of the aortic sinuses or ascending aorta. (B)

- Further imaging: as per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines, obtain cardiac magnetic resonance, TEE or perform cardiac catheterization for assessment of LV systolic function, systolic and diastolic volumes, aortic size and AR severity in patients with moderate or severe AR and suboptimal TTE images or a discrepancy between clinical and TTE findings. (B)

## Medical Management

### Pharmacotherapy

As per ESC 2024 guidelines, consider initiating renin-angiotensin system blockers as part of treatment in patients with a history of AR requiring BP-lowering treatment. (C)

As per ESH 2023 guidelines:

As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines:
- Initiate treatment of hypertension (SBP > 140 mmHg) in asymptomatic patients with chronic AR. (B)
