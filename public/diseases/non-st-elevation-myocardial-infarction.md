# Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction

## Background

### What's new

The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) have updated their guidelines for the management of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS). A routine invasive approach is recommended for high- and intermediate-risk patients, while a routine or selective invasive approach is suggested for low-risk patients. Angiography before hospital discharge is suggested for non-high-risk patients intended for an invasive strategy. Upstream clopidogrel or ticagrelor is suggested for patients planned for an invasive strategy when angiography is expected to be delayed >24 hours, while ticagrelor is recommended for those managed without planned invasive evaluation. PCI of significant non-culprit lesions is recommended at the time of the index procedure or as a staged procedure in stable patients with multivessel disease but without left main stenosis undergoing culprit-lesion PCI.

## Classification and Risk Stratification

### Prognostic Assessment:
As per AAFP 2024 guidelines, Refer patients presenting with acute chest pain and high suspicion of ACS to the emergency department and use predictive risk scores there to aid in the prognosis, diagnosis, and management.  (B)

As per ESC 2023 guidelines, Consider using established risk scores, such as the GRACE risk score, for prognosis estimation. (C)

As per ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines:
- Stratify patients based on the likelihood of ACS and adverse outcomes to decide on the need for hospitalization and assist in the selection of treatment options.  (B)

- Use risk scores to assess prognosis in patients with NSTEMI. (A)

- Consider using risk stratification models in the management of patients with NSTEMI.  (B)

- Consider using the presence and magnitude of troponin elevations for short- and long-term prognosis.  (B)

- Consider obtaining BNP to provide additional prognostic information. (C)

## Diagnostic Investigations

### History and Physical Examination:
As per AAFP 2024 guidelines, Elicit medical history and perform a physical examination in patients presenting with acute chest pain and high suspicion of ACS.  (B)

### ECG:
As per ACC/ACEP/AHA/.../SCAI 2025 guidelines:
- Obtain and interpret a 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes of first medical contact in patients with suspected ACS to guide management.  (B)

- Obtain serial 12-lead ECGs to detect potential ischemic changes in patients with suspected ACS when the initial ECG is nondiagnostic, particularly if clinical suspicion of ACS is high, symptoms persist, or the clinical condition deteriorates.  (B)

As per AAFP 2024 guidelines:
- Obtain a 12-lead ECG in patients with acute chest pain and high suspicion of ACS within 10 minutes of presentation.  (B)

As per ESC 2023 guidelines:
- Obtain a 12-lead ECG as soon as possible at first medical contact with a target of < 10 minutes.  (B)

- Obtain continuous ECG monitoring and ensure the availability of defibrillator capacity as soon as possible in all patients with suspected STEMI, in suspected ACS with other ECG changes, or ongoing chest pain, and once the diagnosis of myocardial infarction is made.  (B)

- Use additional ECG leads (V3R, V4R, and V7-V9) in patients with inferior STEMI or suspected total vessel occlusion with inconclusive standard leads.  (B)

- Obtain an additional 12-lead ECG in patients with recurrent symptoms or diagnostic uncertainty.  (B)

### Echocardiogram:
As per ESC 2023 guidelines:
- Obtain an emergency TTE in patients with suspected ACS presenting with cardiogenic shock or suspected mechanical complications.  (B)

- Consider obtaining an emergency TTE at triage in cases of diagnostic uncertainty while not delaying transfer to the cardiac catheterization laboratory if there is suspicion of an acute coronary artery occlusion. (C)

- Consider obtaining contrast-enhanced echocardiography to detect LV thrombus if the apex is not well visualized on echocardiography following an acute anterior myocardial infarction. (C)

### Cardiac Troponin:
As per ACC/ACEP/AHA/.../SCAI 2025 guidelines:
- Obtain cardiac troponin as soon as possible in patients with suspected ACS, preferably using a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assay.  (B)

- Obtain repeat measurements in patients with suspected ACS with an initial nondiagnostic high-sensitivity cardiac troponin or cardiac troponin at 1-2 hours for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin and 3-6 hours for conventional cardiac troponin after the initial sample collection.  (B)

As per AAFP 2024 guidelines:
- Obtain high-sensitivity cardiac troponin measurement in patients with acute chest pain and high suspicion of ACS at initial presentation and 3 hours after symptom onset.  (B)

As per ESC 2023 guidelines:
- Obtain cardiac troponin measurements with high-sensitivity assays immediately after presentation and retrieve results within 60 minutes of blood sampling.  (B)

- Use an ESC algorithmic approach with serial high-sensitivity cardiac troponin measurements (0 hour/1 hour or 0 hour/2 hours) to rule in and rule out NSTEMI.  (B)

- Obtain additional testing after 3 hours if the first two high-sensitivity cardiac troponin measurements of the 0 hour/1 hour algorithm are inconclusive and no alternative diagnoses explaining the condition have been made.  (B)

### Coronary CTA:

- Do not obtain routine, early coronary CTA in patients with suspected ACS. (D)

As per ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines:
