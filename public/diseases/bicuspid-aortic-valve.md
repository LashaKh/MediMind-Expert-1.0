# Bicuspid Aortic Valve

## Background

### Overview

#### **Definition**
BAV is a common congenital cardiac abnormality consisting of two cusps instead of three that is characterized by dilatation of the thoracic aorta.

#### **Pathophysiology**
The exact cause of BAV is unknown; however, genetic causes (Anderson syndrome, NOTCH1 mutation) have been implicated.

#### **Disease Course**
The fusion of the aortic cusps during valvulogenesis results in the BAV, which can cause clinical manifestations of severe aortic stenosis (symptoms of dyspnea, syncope, and chest pain), aortic regurgitation, aortic incompetence, aortopathy leading to aneurysm and dissection, infective endocarditis to asymptomatic disease.

#### **Prognosis and Risk of Recurrence**
BAV in patients with definite infective endocarditis of the native aortic valve is associated with a 9% in-hospital mortality.

## Guidelines

### Key Sources

## Screening and Diagnosis

### Indications for Screening
As per ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines, obtain TTE and cardiac MRI at the time of diagnosis to evaluate for BAV, aortic root and ascending aortic dilation, aortic coarctation, and other congenital heart defects in patients with Turner syndrome. (B)
