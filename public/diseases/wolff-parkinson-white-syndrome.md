# Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome


## Guidelines

### Key sources
The following summarized guidelines for the evaluation and management of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome are prepared by our editorial team based on guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC 2020), the American Heart Association (AHA/HRS/ACC 2016), and the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS/PACES 2012).

## Clinical Findings

### Symptoms
- Chest pain
- Dizziness
- Lightheadedness
- Palpitations
- Pre-syncope
- Syncope

### ECG findings
- Delta wave
- WPW triad
  - ↑ QRS duration
  - ↓ PR duration

### Cardiac exam
- Paradoxic split of second heart sound

## Diagnostic Investigations

### Electrocardiography:
- **ESC 2020 guidelines:** Consider obtaining noninvasive evaluation of the conducting properties of the accessory pathway in asymptomatic patients with pre-excitation. (C)

**ACC/AHA/HRS 2016 guidelines:** Elicit any of the following in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with pre-excitation to identify patients at low risk of developing rapid conduction over the pathway:
  - abrupt loss of conduction over the pathway during exercise testing in sinus rhythm (B)
  - intermittent loss of pre-excitation during ECG or ambulatory monitoring. (B)

As per HRS/PACES 2012 guidelines:
  - Consider obtaining exercise stress testing in the evaluation of pediatric patients old enough to comply with the testing, if the ambulatory ECG exhibits persistent pre-excitation. (C)
  - Recognize that the ECG and exercise testing may be difficult to interpret in pediatric patients with subtle pre-excitation.

## Diagnostic Procedures

### Electrophysiology study:

As per ESC 2020 guidelines:
- Conduct an electrophysiology study using isoprenaline to risk stratify asymptomatic patients with pre-excitation having high-risk occupations/hobbies, and those participating in competitive athletics. (B)
- Conduct an electrophysiology study to risk stratify patients without low-risk characteristics at noninvasive risk stratification. (B)
- Consider conducting an electrophysiology study to risk stratify asymptomatic patients with pre-excitation. (C)

As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2016 guidelines:
- Conduct an electrophysiology study in symptomatic patients with pre-excitation to risk-stratify for life-threatening arrhythmic events. (B)
- Consider conducting an electrophysiology study in asymptomatic patients with pre-excitation to risk-stratify for arrhythmic events. (C)

As per HRS/PACES 2012 guidelines:
- Consider performing invasive risk stratification (transesophageal or intracardiac) to assess the shortest pre-excited R-R interval in AF in pediatric patients, if the noninvasive testing does not demonstrate clear and abrupt loss of pre-excitation. (C)

## Therapeutic Procedures

### Catheter ablation:

As per ESC 2020 guidelines:
- Perform catheter ablation in asymptomatic patients if electrophysiology testing using isoprenaline identifies high-risk properties, such as:
  - shortest pre-excited RR interval during AF ≤ 250 ms
  - accessory pathway effective refractory period ≤ 250 ms
  - multiple accessory pathways
  - inducible accessory pathway-mediated tachycardia (B)

- Perform catheter ablation in high-risk asymptomatic patients with pre-excitation after discussing the risks, especially of heart block associated with ablation of anteroseptal or mid-septal accessory pathways, and benefits of the procedure. (B)

- Consider performing catheter ablation in asymptomatic patients with pre-excitation, and a low-risk accessory pathway at invasive or noninvasive risk stratification. (C)

- Consider performing catheter ablation in asymptomatic patients with pre-excitation and LV dysfunction due to electrical dyssynchrony. (C)

- Consider performing catheter ablation in low-risk asymptomatic patients with pre-excitation in appropriately experienced centers according to patient preferences. (C)

As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2016 guidelines:
- Consider performing catheter ablation of the accessory pathway in asymptomatic patients with pre-excitation if:
  - an electrophysiology study identifies a high risk of arrhythmic events (including rapidly conducting pre-excited AF)
  - the presence of pre-excitation precludes specific employment (such as with pilots). (C)

As per HRS/PACES 2012 guidelines:
- Consider performing catheter ablation in young patients with shortest pre-excited R-R interval ≤ 250 ms in AF (increased risk for SCD), taking into account the procedural risk factors based on the anatomical location of the pathway. (C)

- Consider deferring catheter ablation in young patients with shortest pre-excited R-R interval > 250 ms in AF (low risk for SCD). (C)

- Consider performing ablation in young patients with shortest pre-excited R-R interval > 250 ms in AF at the time of diagnostic study if the location of the pathway and/or patient characteristics do not suggest that ablation may incur an increased risk of adverse events, such as AV block or coronary artery injury. (C)

- Recognize that young patients at low risk might subsequently develop cardiovascular symptoms such as syncope or palpitations. Consider performing catheter ablation in these patients regardless of the prior assessment.

- Recognize that asymptomatic patients with a WPW ECG pattern and structural heart disease are at risk for both AT and atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia, which may result in unfavorable hemodynamics. Consider performing ablation in these patients regardless of the anterograde characteristics of the accessory pathway. (B)

- Consider performing ablation in asymptomatic patients with WPW ECG pattern and ventricular dysfunction secondary to dyssynchronous contractions, regardless of the anterograde characteristics of the bypass tract. (C)

## Specific Circumstances

### Patients with pre-excited AF, pharmacologic management

As per ESC 2020 guidelines:
- Consider administering IV formulations of the following medications for acute management of hemodynamically stable patients with pre-excited AF:
  - ibutilide (C)
  - procainamide (C)
  - flecainide (C)
  - propafenone (C)

- **Do not use IV amiodarone in patients with pre-excited AF.** (D)

### Patients with pre-excited AF, synchronized electrical cardioversion

As per ESC 2020 guidelines:
- Perform synchronized direct current cardioversion for acute management of hemodynamically unstable patients with pre-excited AF. (B)
- Perform synchronized direct current cardioversion for acute management of hemodynamically stable patients with pre-excited AF if drug therapy fails to convert or control the tachycardia. (B)

### Patients with ADHD
As per HRS/PACES 2012 guidelines: Recognize that patients with WPW ECG pattern and ADHD may be prescribed ADHD medications.

## Follow-up and Surveillance

### Observation:
As per ESC 2020 guidelines:
- Consider obtaining clinical follow-up in asymptomatic patients with pre-excitation and a low-risk accessory pathway at invasive risk stratification. (C)

As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2016 guidelines:
- Consider observing asymptomatic patients with pre-excitation, without further evaluation or treatment. (C)
