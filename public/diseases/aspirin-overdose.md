# Aspirin Overdose

## Background

### Overview

#### **Definition**
Aspirin overdose is the plasma salicylate concentration of 300-500 mg/L in mild toxicity, 500-700 mg/L in moderate toxicity, and > 750 mg/L in severity toxicity.

#### **Pathophysiology**
Aspirin overdose is caused by accidental ingestions in children, suicidal or intentional overdoses in adults.

#### **Disease Course**
Acute aspirin overdose results in salicylate poisoning resulting in either mild, moderate, or severe toxicity depending on the plasma salicylate concentration. Mild toxicity presents with burning in the mouth, lethargy, nausea and vomiting, tinnitus, or dizziness. Moderate toxicity includes additional symptoms of tachypnea, hyperpyrexia, sweating, dehydration, loss of coordination, and restlessness. Severe toxicity causes hallucinations, stupor, convulsions, cerebral edema, oliguria, renal failure, cardiovascular failure, metabolic acidosis, and coma.

#### **Prognosis and Risk of Recurrence**
Severe salicylate poisoning results in 5% mortality.

## Classification and Risk Stratification

### Setting of Care
**As per HHS 2007 guidelines:**

- (B)Refer patients with stated or suspected self-harm or who are the victims of a potentially malicious administration of a salicylate to an emergency department immediately, regardless of the dose reported.

- (B)Refer patients with typical symptoms of salicylate toxicity (such as hematemesis, tachypnea, hyperpnea, dyspnea, tinnitus, deafness, lethargy, seizures, unexplained lethargy, or confusion) to an emergency department for evaluation.

- (B)Refer patients who exhibit typical symptoms of salicylate toxicity or nonspecific symptoms (such as unexplained lethargy, confusion, or dyspnea) which could indicate the development of chronic salicylate toxicity, to an emergency department for evaluation.

### Severity Grading
**As per NPIS 2002 guidelines:**

- (E)Very mild poisoning occurs in patients with a salicylate level < 300 mg/L (adults) or < 200 mg/L (children or elderly). These patients are generally asymptomatic.

- (E)Mild poisoning occurs in patients with a salicylate level 300-600 mg/L (adults) or 200-450 mg/L (children or elderly). Clinical features include lethargy, nausea, vomiting, tinnitus, dizziness.

- (E)Moderate poisoning occurs in patients with a salicylate level 600-800 mg/L (adults) or 450-700 mg/L (children or elderly). Clinical features include mild tachypnea, hyperpyrexia, sweating, dehydration, loss of coordination, restlessness.

- (E)Severe poisoning occurs in patients with a salicylate level > 800 mg/L (adults) or > 700 mg/L (children or elderly). Clinical features include hypotension, significant metabolic acidosis after rehydration, renal failure (oliguria), and neurological symptoms.

## Diagnostic Investigations

### Laboratory Investigations
**As per NPIS 2002 guidelines:**

- (E)Obtain serum salicylate levels, renal function and electrolytes, CBC, and INR in patients with aspirin overdose, including measurements performed at least 4 hours after ingestion.

- (E)Obtain an arterial blood gas in patients with symptomatic aspirin overdose.

## Medical Management

### General Principles
**As per NPIS 2002 guidelines:**

- (E)Administer oral or intravenous fluid therapy to patients with mild aspirin overdose.

- (E)Perform urinary alkalinization in addition to other measures in patients with moderate aspirin overdose.

- (E)Perform hemodialysis in addition to other measures in patients with severe aspirin overdose (cautious with volume of bicarbonate if anuric).

### Supportive Care
**As per NPIS 2002 guidelines:**

(E)In patients with aspirin overdose who display severe end-organ manifestations (coma, convulsions, acute renal failure, pulmonary edema):
- Initiate hemodynamic and respiratory support
- Perform arterial blood gas sampling
- Discuss with the poison control center and toxicology
- Consider hemodialysis (see therapeutic procedures section)

### Poison Center Consultation
**As per HHS 2007 guidelines:**

(B)Ensure follow-up communication with the poison center at periodic intervals for at least 12 hours after ingestion of non-enteric-coated salicylate products and for at least 24 hours after the ingestion of enteric-coated aspirin.

### Gastric Decontamination

**As per HHS 2007 guidelines:**
- (D)Avoid intentionally inducing emesis in patients with aspirin overdose.

- (C)Consider the out-of-hospital administration of activated charcoal for acute ingestions of a toxic dose if it is immediately available, no contraindications are present, the patient is not vomiting, and local guidelines for its out-of-hospital use are observed. However, do not delay transportation in order to administer activated charcoal.

**As per NPIS 2002 guidelines:**
- (E)Perform gastric lavage (ensuring the airway is protected) in patients who have taken an aspirin dose > 500 mg/kg within < 1 hour before the presentation, and the dose and time of ingestion are certain.

- (E)Administer oral activated charcoal (ensuring the airway is protected) in patients who have taken:
  - Aspirin with an unknown dose
  - Aspirin ≥ 125 mg/kg
  - > 500 mg/kg > 1 hour ago (as an alternative to gastric lavage)

### Urinary Alkalinization
**As per NPIS 2002 guidelines:**

- (E)Administer 1.26% sodium bicarbonate with 20 to 40 mmol potassium (1,000 mL IV over 3 hours) as the initial strategy for urine alkalinization in adults with aspirin overdose.

- (E)Administer 1 ml/kg 8.4% sodium bicarbonate in 10 ml/kg sodium chloride solution with 1 mmol/kg potassium (IV, at a rate of 2 ml/kg/h) as the initial strategy for urine alkalinization in children with aspirin overdose.

### Management of Metabolic Acidosis
**As per NPIS 2002 guidelines:**

- (E)Administer 8.4% sodium bicarbonate (1 mL/kg IV) in patients with aspirin overdose and serum pH < 7.3, targeting an increase pH to 7.4.

- (E)Consider performing hemodialysis in addition to giving sodium bicarbonate in patients with a serum pH < 7.2 (see therapeutic procedures section).

## Inpatient Care

### Monitoring of Urinary Alkalinization
**As per NPIS 2002 guidelines:**

- (E)Measure urine pH every 1 hour, targeting a urine pH of 7.5-8.5; increase the rate of bicarbonate administration if the urine pH remains < 7.5 (note: avoid serum pH > 7.55, closely monitor serum sodium).

- (E)Check electrolytes and renal function every 3 hours, and administer supplemental potassium as needed to keep the serum potassium in the range 4.0 to 4.5.

## Therapeutic Procedures

### Indications for ECTR (Extracorporeal Treatment)
**As per EXTRIP 2015 guidelines:**

- (B)ECTR is recommended in severe salicylate poisoning.

- (B)ECTR is recommended if the salicylate concentration is greater than 7.2 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) after acute salicylate poisoning.

- (B)ECTR is suggested if the acetylsalicylic acid concentration is greater than 6.5 mmol/L (90 mg/dL).

- (B)ECTR is recommended if acetylsalicylic acid concentration is greater than 6.5 mmol/L (90 mg/dL) in patients with impaired kidney function.

- (B)ECTR is suggested if acetylsalicylic acid concentration is greater than 5.8 mmol/L (80 mg/dL) in patients with impaired kidney function.

- (B)ECTR is suggested if the blood pH is less than or equal to 7.20.

- (B)ECTR is recommended in the presence of altered mental status.

- (B)ECTR is recommended in the presence of new hypoxemia requiring supplemental oxygen.

- (B)ECTR is recommended if standard therapy (supportive measures, bicarbonate, etc) fails.

- (B)ECTR cessation is indicated when clinical improvement is apparent and a salicylate concentration is less than 1.4 mmol/L or 19 mg/dL or ECTR has been performed for a period of at least 4 to 6 hours when salicylate concentrations are not readily available.

- (B)It is recommended to continue intravenous bicarbonate therapy between ECTR sessions.

- (B)It is suggested not to perform ECTR on the basis of acetylsalicylic acid ingestion history alone.

### ECTR Modality
**As per EXTRIP 2015 guidelines:**

- (B)Use intermittent hemodialysis as the preferred modality of ECTR in patients with aspirin overdose.

- (C)Consider using one of the following alternative modalities if hemodialysis is not feasible:
  - Hemoperfusion
  - Continuous RRT

- (C)Consider using exchange transfusion as an acceptable alternative to hemodialysis in neonates with aspirin overdose.

## Specific Circumstances

### Patients with Dermal Exposure
**As per HHS 2007 guidelines:**

- (B)Perform skin washing with soap and water in asymptomatic patients with dermal exposures to salicylates.

- (C)Consider discharging asymptomatic patients with dermal exposures to salicylates after skin washing, with observation at home for the development of symptoms.

### Patients with Ocular Exposure
**As per HHS 2007 guidelines:**

- (B)Perform ocular irrigation with room-temperature tap water for 15 minutes in patients with an ocular exposure to salicylates.

- (B)Obtain an ophthalmological consultation if ocular pain, decreased visual acuity, or persistent ocular irritation is present after irrigation.

## Follow-up and Surveillance

### Discharge from Hospital
**As per NPIS 2002 guidelines:**

- (E)Obtain an assessment of the patient's mental state and risk of repeated episodes of deliberate self-harm before discharge, ideally performed by a psychiatrist or psychiatric liaison nurse.

- (E)Consider discharging asymptomatic patients with an ingested dose < 125 mg/kg, if sure of dose. Advise to return if develops any symptoms, particularly vomiting, tinnitus, sweating.

- (E)Consider discharging stable patients in whom salicylate levels have peaked and peak level < 300 mg/L (adults) or < 200 mg/L (children/elderly). Advise to return if develops any symptoms, particularly vomiting, tinnitus, sweating.
