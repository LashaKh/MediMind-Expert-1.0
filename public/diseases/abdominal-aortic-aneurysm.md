# Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm

## Background

### Overview

#### **Definition**  
An AAA is a structural disease of the abdominal aorta characterized by a pathological, localized dilatation of > 30 mm or > 50% of the original aortic size.

#### **Pathophysiology**  
Multiple environmental factors (including smoking, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and collagen diseases) and genetic factors can induce and accelerate degeneration of the layers of the aortic wall. An inflammatory response in the aortic vessel wall leads to destruction of elastin and collagen in the media and adventitia, loss of smooth muscle cells, thinning of the media, and neovascularization.

#### **Epidemiology**  
In the US, the overall prevalence of AAA is estimated at 2,200 persons per 100,000 population.

#### **Disease Course**  
The majority of AAAs are asymptomatic and are detected as an incidental finding on diagnostic imaging performed for other purposes. AAAs can also present with abdominal pain or complications such as thrombosis, embolization and rupture.

#### **Prognosis and Risk of Recurrence**  
The overall mortality associated with ruptured AAA is approximately 85-90%.
