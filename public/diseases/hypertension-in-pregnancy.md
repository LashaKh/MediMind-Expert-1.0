## Screening and diagnosis

### Indications for screening:

As per USPSTF 2023 guidelines, Obtain screening for hypertensive disorders with BP measurements throughout pregnancy. (B)

### Diagnostic investigations

#### BP measurement

As per ISSHP 2022 guidelines:

- Obtain BP measurement using a standardized technique, including patient's position (sitting, feet flat on the floor), cuff size (large if the mid-upper arm circumference is ≥ 33 cm), Korotkoff V for the DBP, and arm used (both, at least initially). (B)

- Obtain BP measurement in pregnancy or postpartum, in any setting, using a device validated for use in pregnancy and preeclampsia. (B)

- Define hypertension as an SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg, based on an average of at least two measurements. (A)

- Repeat BP measurement to confirm true hypertension. Repeat measurement within 15 minutes if hypertension is severe (SBP ≥ 160 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 110 mmHg); otherwise, repeat in at least 4 hours or on two consecutive outpatient visits. (E)

#### Home and ambulatory BP monitoring:

As per ESC 2024 guidelines, Consider Obtaining home BP monitoring and ambulatory BP monitoring to exclude white coat hypertension and masked hypertension, as they are more common in pregnancy. (C)

As per SOMANZ 2024 guidelines:

- Consider Obtaining ambulatory BP monitoring to exclude white coat hypertension in females with isolated hypertension in pregnancy (in the absence of an established diagnosis of preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, or gestational hypertension). (E)

- Consider Obtaining ambulatory BP monitoring to assess for masked hypertension where there are poor pregnancy outcomes in current or previous pregnancies that could not be explained by other factors. (E)

#### Evaluation for secondary hypertension

(B)

- Obtain quantitative proteinuria testing for preeclampsia in patients with suspected or at high risk of developing preeclampsia. Define proteinuria as ≥ 30 mg/mmol urine protein-to-creatinine ratio in a spot urine sample, albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 8 mg/mmol, or ≥ 0.3 g/day in a complete 24-hour urine collection, or ≥ 2+ by urinary dipstick if confirmatory testing is not available. (B)

- Obtain evaluation of angiogenic imbalance, when available, as a marker of uteroplacental dysfunction in conjunction with other clinical tests in patients with suspected preeclampsia (< 37 weeks of gestation). (B)

- Do not use BP elevation to make a diagnosis of preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension. (D)

As per SOGC 2022 guidelines, Obtain screening at least for clinical risk markers for preeclampsia in early pregnancy. Obtain screening at 11-14 weeks of gestation, if testing is available, using a combination of clinical risk markers, uterine artery pulsatility index, and placental growth factor to individualize the risk of developing preeclampsia. (B)
