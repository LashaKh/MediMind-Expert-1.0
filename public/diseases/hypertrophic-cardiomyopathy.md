# Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy


## Background

### Definition
HCM is a genetic disorder characterized by LVH and a non-dilated left ventricle with preserved or increased ejection fraction. ¹

### Pathophysiology
HCM is most frequently caused by genetic mutations in genes (β-myosin heavy chain [MYH7] and myosin binding protein C [MYBPC3]) encoding sarcomere proteins. LVH leads to diastolic dysfunction, reduced systolic output volume, decreased peripheral and myocardial perfusion, cardiac arrhythmia and/or HF and finally increased risk of SCD. ¹

### Epidemiology
The prevalence of HCM in the US is low, with an estimated 200 cases per 100,000 population. HCM incidence is bimodal (peak incidence in the second decade and third decade of life). ²

### Disease course
Clinical manifestations include symptoms due to increased LV end-diastolic pressure (exertional dyspnea, exercise intolerance, orthopnea, peripheral edema, and HFpEF), LV outflow obstruction (exertional or immediately post-exertional syncope, ventricular arrhythmia), chest pain, palpitations, VT. Disease progression may lead to AF, hypertension, valvular disease, HF, and SCD. ¹

### Prognosis and risk of recurrence
HCM is associated with an annual mortality rate of 0.5%, and mortality is higher in children. However, SCD is often the first clinical manifestation. ³

## Introduction

Levels of evidence help you to target your search at the type of evidence that is most likely to provide a reliable answer. It has been designed so that it can be used as a shortcut for busy clinicians, researchers, or patients to find the likely best evidence.

Grades of evidence describe the strength and therefore value of the evidence relative to how rigorous the study was.

### Levels of Evidence

What are we to do when the irresistible force of the need to offer clinical advice meets with the immovable object of flawed evidence? All we can do is our best: give the advice, but alert the advisees to the flaws in the evidence on which it is based.

This has been adapted from Sackett, Straus and Richardson (2000).
