# Focal Atrial Tachycardia


## Guidelines

### Key Sources
The following summarized guidelines for the management of focal atrial tachycardia are prepared by our editorial team based on guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC 2020) and the American Heart Association (AHA/HRS/ACC 2016).

## Medical Management

### Acute Management

As per ESC 2020 Guidelines, 

Consider administering intravenous adenosine (6-18 mg bolus) for acute management of hemodynamically stable patients with FAT. 
(C)

Consider administering IV formulations of the following medications for acute management of hemodynamically stable patients with FAT in the absence of decompensated HF, if adenosine fails:**
- β-blockers, i.e. esmolol or metoprolol
- nondihydropyridine CCBs, i.e. verapamil or diltiazem
(C)

Consider administering IV formulations of the following medications for acute management of hemodynamically stable patients with FAT if adenosine, β-blockers, and nondihydropyridine CCBs fail:
- ibutilide
- flecainide
- propafenone
- amiodarone
(C)

As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2016 Guidelines:

Administer IV formulations of the following medications for acute management of hemodynamically stable patients with FAT:
- β-blockers
- diltiazem
- verapamil
(B)

Consider administering adenosine in the acute setting to either restore sinus rhythm or diagnose the tachycardia mechanism in patients with suspected FAT.
(C)

Consider administering IV amiodarone in the acute setting to either restore sinus rhythm or slow the ventricular rate in hemodynamically stable patients with FAT.
(C)

Consider administering ibutilide in the acute setting to restore sinus rhythm in hemodynamically stable patients with FAT.
(C)

### Ongoing Management

As per ESC 2020 Guidelines:

Consider initiating the following medications for the management of patients with FAT if ablation is not desirable or feasible:
- β-blockers
- nondihydropyridine CCBs (verapamil or diltiazem) in the absence of HFrEF
- propafenone or flecainide in the absence of structural or ischemic heart disease
(C)

Consider initiating a combination of ivabradine and a β-blocker for the management of patients with FAT if monotherapy fails.
(C)

Consider initiating amiodarone for the management of patients with FAT if the above measures fail.
(C)

As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2016 Guidelines:

Consider initiating oral formulations of the following medications for ongoing management of patients with symptomatic FAT:
- β-blockers
- diltiazem
- verapamil
(C)

Consider initiating the following medications for ongoing management of patients without structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease who have FAT:
- flecainide
- propafenone
(C)

Consider initiating oral formulations of the following medications for ongoing management of patients with FAT:
- sotalol
- amiodarone
(C)

## Therapeutic Procedures

### Synchronized Electrical Cardioversion

As per ESC 2020 Guidelines:

Perform synchronized direct current cardioversion for acute management of hemodynamically unstable patients with FAT.
(B)

Perform synchronized direct current cardioversion for acute management of hemodynamically stable patients with FAT if drug therapy fails to convert or control the tachycardia.
(B)

As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2016 Guidelines:

Perform synchronized cardioversion for acute management of hemodynamically unstable patients with FAT.
(B)

### Catheter Ablation

As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2016 Guidelines:

Perform catheter ablation as an alternative to pharmacological therapy in symptomatic patients with FAT.
(B)
