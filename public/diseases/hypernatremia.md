# Hypernatremia


## Guidelines

### Key Sources

The following summarized guidelines for the evaluation and management of hypernatremia are prepared by our editorial team based on guidelines from the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP 2023) and the Society for Endocrinology (SE 2018).

## Clinical Findings

### Symptoms
- Increased thirst
- Irritability
- Polyuria
- Seizure
- Urinary frequency

### Past Events
- ↓ water intake

### Past Medical History
- Head trauma

## Classification and Risk Stratification

### Classification
As per SE 2018 guidelines, classify hypernatremia according to the serum sodium level:

| Situation | Serum Sodium Level | Evidence Level |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Mild | 146-149 mmol/L | E |
| Moderate | 150-159 mmol/L | E |
| Severe | > 160 mmol/L | E |

## Medical Management

### Fluid Replacement
As per AAFP 2023 guidelines, Consider correcting hypernatremia in adult patients at a rate of 12 mEq/L over 24 hours. Avoid increasing serum sodium again for therapeutic purposes if the recommended correction rate is exceeded. (C)

## Specific Circumstances

### Patients with Central Diabetes Insipidus

As per SE 2018 guidelines:

1. **Acute Hypernatremia (Symptomatic patients with hypernatremia developed within 48 hours):**
   - Correct serum sodium at a rate of 5 mmol/L in the first hour (or until symptoms improve) and limited to 10 mmol/L per 24 hours. (E)

2. **Chronic Hypernatremia (Patients with no or mild symptoms):**
   - Correct hypernatremia at a rate not exceeding 0.5 mmol/L per hour and limited to 10 mmol/L per 24 hours. (E)

3. **Fluid Replacement Strategy:**
   - Decide on the type and volume of fluid replacement in patients with hypernatremia reflecting the standard daily fluid and electrolyte requirement together with a component of the estimated fluid deficit such that correction of hypernatremia is controlled. (E)

4. **Vasopressin Administration:**
   - Administer IV or IM vasopressin 1-2 mcg in patients with known central diabetes insipidus and excessive, inappropriately dilute urine output, with close observation of the clinical and biochemical response. Consider administering further doses of desmopressin when production of higher volumes of dilute (100 mosmol/kg) urine returns to avoid the development of overly rapid correction of hypernatremia through the combination of high fluid loads together with the obligate antidiuresis of exogenous desmopressin. (E)
