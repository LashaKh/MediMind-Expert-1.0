Surgical interventions
Choice of prosthetic valve, general principles
As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines: 
Decide on the choice of prosthetic valve in patients requiring heart valve replacement based on a shared decision-making process, taking into account the patient's values and preferences, including a discussion of the indications for and risks of anticoagulant therapy and the potential need for and risks associated with valve reintervention. 
B
  
Consider individualizing the choice between mechanical and bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement in 50-65 years old patients requiring aortic valve replacement and not having contraindications to anticoagulation, taking into account individual patient factors and after informed shared decision-making. 
C
  
Choice of prosthetic valve, mechanical prostheses:
As per EACTS/ESC 2022 guidelines: 
Use a mechanical prosthesis according to the desire of the informed patient and if there are no contraindications to long-term anticoagulation. 
B
  
Use a mechanical prosthesis in patients at risk of accelerated structural valve deterioration. 
B
  
Consider using a mechanical prosthesis in patients already on anticoagulation because of a mechanical prosthesis in another valve position.

C
  
Consider using a mechanical prosthesis in patients with a reasonable life expectancy if a future redo valve surgery or TAVI (if appropriate) would be at high risk. 
C
  
Consider using a mechanical prosthesis in patients already on long-term anticoagulation due to the high risk for thromboembolism.

Choice of prosthetic valve, biological prostheses:
As per EACTS/ESC 2022 guidelines: 
Use a bioprosthesis according to the desire of the informed patient. 
B
  
Use a bioprosthesis when good-quality anticoagulation is unlikely (adherence problems, not readily available), contraindicated because of high bleeding risk (previous major bleed, comorbidities, unwillingness, adherence problems, lifestyle, occupation), and in patients with a life expectancy lower than the presumed durability of the bioprosthesis. 
B
  
Use a bioprosthesis in case of reoperation for mechanical valve thrombosis despite good long-term anticoagulant control.

C
  
As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines: 
For patients of any age requiring valve replacement for whom anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated, cannot be managed appropriately, or is not desired, a bioprosthetic valve is recommended. 
B
  
In patients > 65 years of age who require AVR, it is reasonable to choose a bioprosthesis over a mechanical valve.

For patients ≥ 65 years of age who require mitral valve replacement and are unable to undergo mitral valve repair, it is reasonable to choose a bioprosthesis over a mechanical valve. 
B
  
In patients < 50 years of age who prefer a bioprosthetic AVR and have appropriate anatomy, replacement of the aortic valve by a pulmonic autograft (the Ross procedure) may be considered at a Comprehensive Valve Center. 
B

A
  
Consider initiating VKAs throughout pregnancy with replacement by UFH or LMWH close to delivery in patients deemed at very high risk of thromboembolism with concerns about the efficacy and safety of UFH or LMWH (such as older generation prosthesis in the mitral position or history of thromboembolism).

C
  
Follow-up and surveillance
