**Updated:** June 2, 2025


## What's New

The National Lipid Association (NLA) and the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) have published a new guideline for the management of hypercholesterolemia in adults over 75 years without a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Statin therapy is suggested for patients with an LDL-C of 70-189 mg/dL for primary prevention of ASCVD, despite potential risks of statin-associated muscle symptoms, new-onset type 2 diabetes, and drug-induced cognitive impairment, provided there is no life-limiting illness. Ezetimibe is suggested for additional LDL-C and ASCVD risk reduction, and bempedoic acid is suggested for statin-intolerant patients. LDL-C monitoring every 3-12 months is recommended during treatment. Statin deprescribing is suggested in cases of life-limiting illness or an estimated survival of <1 year to improve quality of life.

## Background

### Overview

#### **Definition**
Dyslipidemia is a disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by elevated LDL cholesterol, decreased HDL cholesterol and/or increased triglycerides, which contributes to the development of atherosclerosis.

#### **Pathophysiology**
Primary dyslipidemia is due to genetic abnormalities, whereas secondary dyslipidemia is multifactorial, and is associated with obesity, physical inactivity, high-carbohydrate and high-fat diets, smoking, alcohol use, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, renal failure, cholestatic liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, and various drugs (corticosteroids, progestogens, androgenic steroids, thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, oral estrogens, retinoic acid derivatives).

#### **Epidemiology**
In the US, an estimated 53% of adults have at least one lipid abnormality: 27% have elevated LDL cholesterol, 23% have decreased HDL cholesterol, and 30% have increased triglycerides.

#### **Disease Course**
Lipid abnormalities contribute to the formation of atherosclerotic plaque, leading to an increased risk of CVD, stroke, and PAD.

#### **Prognosis and Risk of Recurrence**
Treatment with statins is associated with a relative reduction in the risk of major adverse vascular events of 22% in men and 16% in women for every 1.0 mmol/L (38.6 mg/dL) reduction in LDL cholesterol.

## Screening and Diagnosis

### Indications for screening, adults, lipid profile:
As per DoD/VA 2020 guidelines, Consider obtaining a lipid panel no more often than every 10 years for primary prevention in patients not on statin therapy. (C)

As per AAPA/ABC/ACC/…/PCNA 2019 guidelines:
- Obtain a fasting or a non-fasting plasma lipid profile to estimate CVD risk and document baseline LDL-C in adult patients aged ≥ 20 years not receiving lipid-lowering therapy. (B)
- Consider obtaining a fasting lipid profile in adult patients aged ≥ 20 years with a family history of premature atherosclerotic vascular disease or genetic hyperlipidemia, to aid in the understanding and identification of familial lipid disorders. (C)

### Indications for screening, adults, ApoB and LPa
As per CCS 2021 guidelines:
- Obtain non-HDL-C or ApoB over LDL-C as the preferred lipid parameter for screening in patients with triglycerides > 1.5 mmol/L. (A)
- Obtain lipoprotein(a) level measurement once in a person's lifetime as a part of the initial lipid screening. (A)

### Classification and risk stratification

#### Risk assessment:
As per AACE 2025 guidelines, Use a validated tool or calculator to predict future risk of ASCVD events in adult patients with dyslipidemia as part of shared decision-making around treatment. (E)

As per EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines:
- Obtain total risk estimation using a risk estimation system such as SCORE in asymptomatic patients > 40 years old without evidence of CVD, diabetes mellitus, CKD or hypercholesterolemia, or with LDL-C level of > 190 mg/dL (> 4.9 mmoI/L). (B)
- Do not use risk scores developed for the general population for cardiovascular risk assessment in patients with diabetes mellitus or familial hypercholesterolemia. (D)
- Identify high and very high-risk patients based on documentation of CVD, diabetes mellitus, moderate-to-severe renal disease, very high levels of individual risk factors, familial hypercholesterolemia, or a high SCORE risk. (B)
- View patients with KDOQI stage 3-5 CKD as high or very high-risk patients for ASCVD. (A)
- Set a priority to provide advice and management of all risk factors in high and very high-risk patients. (B)

### Diagnostic investigations

#### Lipid profile, tests:
As per EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines:
- Obtain LDL-C as the primary lipid analysis method for screening, diagnosis, and management. (B)
- Obtain total cholesterol for the estimation of total cardiovascular risk by means of the SCORE system. (B)
- Obtain triglycerides as part of the routine lipid analysis process. (B)
- Obtain HDL-C to further refine risk estimation using the online SCORE system. (B)
- Obtain non-HDL-C for risk assessment, particularly in patients with: high triglycerides levels, very low LDL-C levels, diabetes mellitus, obesity (B)

As per AAPA/ABC/ACC/…/PCNA 2019 guidelines:
- Measure either a fasting or a nonfasting plasma lipid profile in ≥ 20 years old patients and not on lipid-lowering therapy to estimate ASCVD risk and to document baseline LDL-C. (B)
- Consider measuring direct LDL-C or modified LDL-C estimate to improve accuracy over the Friedewald formula, in adult patients with an LDL-C level < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L). (C)

As per CCS 2016 guidelines, Consider using non-HDL-C levels as an alternative to LDL-C for the evaluation of cardiovascular risk in adult patients. (B)

#### Lipid profile, fasting state:
As per AAPA/ABC/ACC/…/PCNA 2019 guidelines, Consider obtaining a repeat lipid profile in the fasting state in patients with an initial nonfasting lipid profile showing triglyceride levels ≥ 400 mg/dL (≥ 4.5 mmol/L). (B)

As per CCS 2016 guidelines, Consider measuring lipid and lipoprotein levels in the fasting state in patients with a history of triglyceride levels > 400 mg/dL (> 4.5 mmol/L). (C)

#### ApoB:
As per EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines:
- Obtain ApoB for risk assessment, particularly in patients with: high triglyceride levels, very low LDL-C levels, metabolic syndrome, obesity (B)
- Consider obtaining ApoB as an alternative to LDL-C, if available, as the primary measurement for screening, diagnosis, and management. (B)
- Consider preferring ApoB over HDL-C in patients with: high triglycerides levels, VLDL-C levels, diabetes mellitus, obesity (B)

As per CCS 2016 guidelines, Consider using ApoB levels as an alternative to LDL-C for the evaluation of cardiovascular risk in adult patients. (B)

#### Lipoprotein(a):
As per EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines:
- Consider obtaining lipoprotein(a) at least once in each adult person's lifetime to identify patients with very high inherited lipoprotein(a) levels > 180 mg/dL (> 430 mmol/L) having a lifetime risk of ASCVD equivalent to the risk associated with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. (C)
- Consider obtaining lipoprotein(a) in selected patients with a family history of premature CVD, and for reclassification in patients at borderline between moderate and high risk. (C)

As per CCS 2016 guidelines, Consider using lipoprotein A levels to refine risk assessment in patients with an intermediate Framingham Risk Score, or a family history of premature coronary artery disease. (C)

#### Screening for hypothyroidism: 
As per ES 2020 guidelines, Evaluate for and rule out hypothyroidism as the cause of hyperlipidemia before initiating lipid-lowering therapy in patients with hyperlipidemia. (A)

#### Screening for anabolic steroid use: 
As per ES 2020 guidelines, Obtain clinical or biochemical evaluation for anabolic steroid abuse in patients with low HDL (< 30 mg/dL; 0.8 mmol/L), especially in the absence of hypertriglyceridemia.

#### Coronary CT:
As per CCS 2021 guidelines:
- Consider obtaining CAC screening using CT in asymptomatic adults ≥ 40 years of age and at intermediate risk (Framingham Risk Score 10-20%), if treatment decisions are uncertain. (B)
- Do not obtain CAC screening with CT in the following individuals: high-risk individuals, patients receiving statin treatment, most asymptomatic, low-risk adults (D)
- Consider obtaining CAC screening in a subset of low-risk individuals ≥ 40 years of age with a family history of premature ASCVD (males ≤ 55 years, females ≤ 65 years) in addition to identifying known genetic causes of ASCVD, such as elevated lipoprotein(a) level or familial hypercholesterolemia. (C)

As per EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines, Consider obtaining coronary CT for the assessment of CAC score as a risk modifier in the cardiovascular risk assessment in asymptomatic patients at low or moderate risk. (C)

As per SCCT 2013 guidelines, Avoid obtaining CAC scoring for screening purposes in low-risk asymptomatic individuals, except in those with a family history of premature coronary artery disease. (D)

#### Arterial ultrasound: 
As per EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines, Consider obtaining arterial ultrasound to assess arterial (carotid and/or femoral) plaque burden as a risk modifier in patients at low or moderate risk. (C)

## Medical Management

As per EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines, Initiate a high-intensity statin up to the highest tolerated dose to reach the goals set for the specific level of risk. (A)

As per AAPA/ABC/ACC/…/PCNA 2019 guidelines:
- Consider using CAC score in the decision to withhold, postpone, or initiate statin therapy in intermediate-risk or selected borderline-risk adult patients if the decision about statin use remains uncertain. (C)
- Decide on the initiation of statin therapy in intermediate-risk or selected borderline-risk adult patients based on the CAC score:

| Situation | Guidance |
|-----------|----------|
| CAC score 0 | Consider withholding statin therapy and reassessing in 5-10 years, as long as higher risk conditions are absent including diabetes mellitus, family history of premature coronary artery disease, or cigarette smoking |
| CAC score 1-99 | Consider initiating statin therapy in patients ≥ 55 years old |
| CAC score ≥ 100 or ≥ 75th percentile | Consider initiating statin therapy |

(B)

- Administer a moderate-intensity statin in intermediate-risk adult patients if a decision is made for statin therapy in the context of a risk discussion, as statin therapy reduces the risk of ASCVD. (A)
- Initiate or intensify statin therapy in the presence of risk-enhancing factors in intermediate-risk adult patients. (B)
- Consider initiating moderate-intensity statin therapy in the presence of risk-enhancing factors in borderline-risk patients. (C)

- Obtain CK levels in patients treated with statins having severe statin-associated muscle symptoms and objective muscle weakness, and measure liver transaminases as well as TBIL and ALP if there are symptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity. (B)
- Consider initiating statins after obtaining baseline measurements and determining a schedule of monitoring and safety checks in patients at increased ASCVD risk with chronic, stable liver disease, including MASLD, when appropriately indicated. (B)
- Consider using RCT-proven non-statin therapy that is likely to provide net clinical benefit in patients at increased ASCVD risk with severe statin-associated muscle symptoms or recurrent statin-associated muscle symptoms despite appropriate statin rechallenge. (C)
- Avoid using routine coenzyme Q10 in patients treated with statins or for treatment of statin-associated muscle symptoms. (D)
- Avoid obtaining routine CK and transaminase levels in patients treated with statins. (D)

As per CCS 2016 guidelines, Evaluate all purported statin-associated symptoms systematically incorporating observation during cessation and reinitiation of statins (same or different statin, same or decreased potency, same or decreased frequency of dosing) to identify a tolerated, statin-based therapy for chronic use. (B)
