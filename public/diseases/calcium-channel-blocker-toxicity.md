# Calcium Channel Blocker Toxicity


## Guidelines

### Key Sources
The following summarized guidelines for the management of calcium channel blocker toxicity are prepared by our editorial team based on guidelines from:
- American Heart Association (AHA 2023)
- American Heart Association (AHA/HRS/ACC 2019) 
- Canadian Association of Poison Control Centres (CAPCC/ESICM/CAEP/AAPCC/SCCM/CPS/EAPCCT/ESEM/CCCS/ACMT 2017)

## Studies

### 2023 • NICO
In comatose patients with suspected acute poisoning and a GCS score < 9, restricted intubation was superior to routine practice with respect to median length of mechanical ventilation.

**Study:** Yonathan Freund et al. JAMA. 2023 Dec 19.

## Clinical Findings

### Intravenous Calcium
As Per AHA 2023 guidelines, 
Consider administering IV calcium in patients with CCB toxicity. (C)

As Per ACC/AHA/HRS 2019 guidelines, 
Consider IV calcium to increase HR and improve symptoms in patients with bradycardia associated with symptoms or hemodynamic compromise because of CCB overdose. (C)

As Per AAPCC/ACMT/CAEP/…/SCCM 2017 guidelines,
  - Administer IV calcium as first-line therapy in patients with symptomatic CCB poisoning. (B)
  - Administer IV calcium, even if previously administered, in addition to standard advanced cardiac life-support in patients with CCB poisoning in cardiac arrest. (B)

### High-Dose Insulin
As Per AHA 2023 guidelines, Administer high-dose insulin for the management of hypotension in patients with CCB toxicity. (B)

As Per ACC/AHA/HRS 2019 guidelines, Consider administering high-dose insulin to increase HR and improve symptoms in patients with bradycardia associated with symptoms or hemodynamic compromise because of CCB overdose. (C)

As Per AAPCC/ACMT/CAEP/…/SCCM 2017 guidelines,
  - Administer high-dose insulin in addition to other first-line treatments in the presence of myocardial dysfunction in patients with CCB poisoning. (B)
  - Consider administering high-dose insulin as monotherapy in the presence of myocardial dysfunction in patients with CCB poisoning. (C)
  - Consider administering high-dose insulin in the absence of documented myocardial dysfunction in patients with CCB poisoning, if used in combination with IV fluids, calcium, and vasopressors. (C)
  - Consider administering incremental doses of high-dose insulin (up to 10 U/kg/hour) in the presence of myocardial dysfunction in patients with CCB poisoning refractory to first-line treatments. (C)
  - Administer incremental doses of high-dose insulin (up to 10 U/kg/hour) as rescue therapy, if not administered previously, in the presence of myocardial dysfunction in patients with CCB poisoning having refractory shock or periarrest despite increasing doses of inotropes and vasopressors. (B)
  - Consider administering incremental doses of high-dose insulin (up to 10 U/kg/hour) as rescue therapy, if not administered previously, even in the absence of myocardial dysfunction in patients with CCB poisoning having refractory shock or periarrest. (C)

### Glucagon
As Per AHA 2023 guidelines, Insufficient evidence to support the use of glucagon bolus and infusion in patients with CCB toxicity. (I)
As Per ACC/AHA/HRS 2019 guidelines, Consider administering glucagon to increase HR and improve symptoms in patients with bradycardia associated with symptoms or hemodynamic compromise because of CCB overdose. (C)

### Vasopressors
As Per AHA 2023 guidelines, Administer vasopressors for the management of hypotension in patients with CCB toxicity. (B)
As Per AAPCC/ACMT/CAEP/…/SCCM 2017 guidelines,
  - Administer norepinephrine and/or epinephrine as first-line therapy in patients with CCB poisoning with shock, even if the myocardial function has not yet been assessed. Prefer norepinephrine in patients with vasodilatory shock. (B)
  - Consider administering dobutamine or epinephrine as first-line therapy in patients with CCB poisoning with cardiogenic shock. (C)
  - Consider administering dopamine as first-line therapy in patients with CCB poisoning with shock. (C)
  - Consider administering vasopressin as a single vasoactive agent in patients with CCB poisoning with documented cardiogenic shock. (C)

### Atropine
As Per AHA 2023 guidelines, Consider administering atropine for the management of hemodynamically significant bradycardia in patients with CCB toxicity. (C)
As Per AAPCC/ACMT/CAEP/…/SCCM 2017 guidelines, Consider administering atropine as first-line therapy in patients with CCB poisoning with symptomatic bradycardia or conduction disturbances. (C)

### Lipid Emulsion Therapy
As Per AHA 2023 guidelines, Do not use routine IV lipid emulsion therapy in patients with CCB toxicity. (D)
As Per AAPCC/ACMT/CAEP/…/SCCM 2017 guidelines,
  - Consider administering IV lipid-emulsion therapy in patients with CCB poisoning refractory to first-line treatments. (C)
  - Administer IV lipid-emulsion therapy as rescue therapy, if not administered previously, in patients with CCB poisoning with refractory shock or periarrest despite increasing doses of inotropes and vasopressors. (B)
  - Administer IV lipid-emulsion therapy, if not administered previously, in addition to standard advanced cardiac life-support in patients with CCB poisoning in cardiac arrest. (B)
  - Consider administering IV lipid-emulsion therapy, even if previously administered, in patients with CCB poisoning in cardiac arrest. (C)

### Methylene Blue
As Per AHA 2023 guidelines, Insufficient evidence to support the use of methylene blue for the management of refractory vasodilatory shock in patients with CCB toxicity. (I)

## Therapeutic Procedures

### Temporary Cardiac Pacing
As Per AHA 2023 guidelines, Consider attempting electrical pacing for the management of refractory bradycardia in patients with CCB toxicity. (C)
As Per AAPCC/ACMT/CAEP/…/SCCM 2017 guidelines,
  - Consider placing a pacemaker in the presence of unstable bradycardia or high-grade AV block without significant alteration in cardiac inotropism in patients with CCB poisoning refractory to first-line treatments. (C)
  - Consider placing a pacemaker as rescue therapy, if not tried previously, in the presence of unstable bradycardia or high-grade AV block without significant alteration in cardiac inotropism in patients with CCB poisoning having refractory shock or peri-arrest. (C)

### ECMO
As Per AHA 2023 guidelines, Consider initiating extracorporeal life support, such as venoarterial ECMO, in patients with cardiogenic shock refractory to pharmacological interventions. (C)
As Per APCC/ACMT/CAEP/…/SCCM 2017 guidelines, Consider performing veno-arterial ECMO, in centers where the treatment is available, in patients with CCB poisoning with cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock. (C)
