# Transient Ischemic Attack


## Background

### Overview

#### **Definition**
A TIA is a brief episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, with clinical symptoms typically lasting less than 1 hour but can persist for up to 24 hours, and without evidence of acute infarction.

#### **Pathophysiology**
The pathophysiology of TIA involves a temporary disruption in blood flow to a specific area of the brain, often due to emboli or thrombi. This leads to ischemia in the affected area, causing transient neurological symptoms. Common conditions causing a TIA include cerebrovascular disorders such as large artery atherosclerosis, carotid or vertebral artery stenosis, and cervical artery dissection; cardiovascular disorders such as AF, valvular heart disease, and infective endocarditis; hypercoagulable conditions such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, cancer, hyperhomocysteinemia, and sickle cell disease; and inflammatory vascular conditions such as FMD, giant cell arteritis, and primary angiitis of the CNS.

#### **Epidemiology**
The incidence of TIA in the US is estimated at 0.7-1.19 per 1,000 person-years.

#### **Risk factors**
Risk factors for TIA include advanced age, male gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, dyslipidemia, tobacco smoking, high sodium intake, high stress, CVDs, and a family history of cerebrovascular accidents.

#### **Disease course**
The clinical course of a TIA is characterized by sudden onset of symptoms that resolve within 24 hours. Symptoms can include motor weakness, dysphasia, altered consciousness, syncope, dizziness, amnesia, confusion, hemianopia, monocular visual loss, isolated diplopia, bilateral visual disturbance, vertigo, ataxia, sensory symptoms, and gait difficulties.

#### **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**
Patients with TIA have an increased risk of subsequent stroke, with a 10-20% risk within the first 90 days after the event, and an increased risk of cardiovascular events for the following 5 years.

## Classification and Risk Stratification

### Risk prediction tools:
As per ESO 2021 guidelines, avoid using prediction tools alone to identify high-risk patients/make triage and treatment decisions in patients with a suspected TIA. 
(D)

As per ACEP 2016 guidelines: 
Do not rely on current existing risk stratification instruments, such as the ABCD² score (age, BP, clinical features, duration of TIA, and presence of diabetes), in adult patients with a suspected TIA to identify patients eligible for safe discharge from the emergency department. 
(D)

Consider using a rapid emergency department-based diagnostic protocol in adult patients with a suspected TIA without high-risk conditions to evaluate patients at short-term risk for stroke. 
(C)

## Diagnostic Investigations

### Timing for initial assessment:
As per AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines, Obtain diagnostic evaluation for gaining insights into the etiology and planning optimal strategies for preventing recurrent stroke, completed or underway within 48 hours of the onset of stroke symptoms, in patients with a TIA. 
(B)

As per ESO 2021 guidelines: 
Obtain a specialist review within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms in patients with a TIA. 
(B)

Consider Obtaining a specialist review in a TIA clinic within 24 hours after the TIA. 
(C)

Consider Obtaining a prompt review in a TIA clinic or admitting to a stroke unit for evaluation by a stroke specialist, depending on local availability and patient preferences, in patients with a suspected high-risk TIA. 


### Brain imaging:
As per AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines: 
Obtain brain CT or MRI to confirm the diagnosis of symptomatic ischemic cerebral vascular disease in patients with a suspected TIA. 
(B)

Consider Obtaining follow-up MRI to predict the risk of early stroke and to support the diagnosis in patients with a suspected TIA, if the initial brain imaging (CT or MRI) does not demonstrate a symptomatic cerebral infarct. 
(C)

Consider Obtaining MRA or CTA of the intracranial large arteries and extracranial vertebrobasilar arterial system to identify atherosclerotic disease, dissection, Moyamoya disease, or other etiologically relevant vasculopathies in patients with a TIA.

Consider Obtaining transcranial Doppler with embolus detection to screen for a right-to-left shunt in patients with a TIA eligible for foramen ovale closure. 
(C)

As per ESO 2021 guidelines, Consider Obtaining MRI (multimodal) or CT perfusion, if feasible, rather than non-contrast CT, to confirm the ischemic pathophysiology of transient neurological symptoms in patients with a suspected TIA, if it will influence treatment and/or in case diagnostic uncertainty. 


As per ACEP 2016 guidelines: 
Obtain MRI with DWI, when feasible, to identify patients at high short-term risk for stroke in adult patients with a suspected TIA. 
(B)

Consider Obtaining non-contrast head CT to identify TIA mimics (such as ICH and mass lesion) if non-contrast brain MRI is not readily available. 
(C)

### Cervical imaging:
As per AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines, Obtain CTA or MRA (or carotid ultrasound) to screen for carotid stenosis in patients with a TIA eligible for revascularization.

As per CCS 2014 guidelines, Obtain continuous ECG monitoring for at least 24 hours to screen for paroxysmal AF in patients with a TIA potentially eligible for OAC therapy. 
(B)

## Medical Management

### Antithrombotic therapy, before imaging: 
As per ESO 2021 guidelines, Consider initiating de novo antiplatelet monotherapy in patients with a suspected TIA if a wait of > 24 hours to planned imaging is foreseen and a delay is judged to increase the risk of further ischemic events, above the risk of starting antiplatelet medication. 
(C)

### Antithrombotic therapy, intracranial atherosclerotic disease:
As per ESO 2022 guidelines: 
Consider initiating dual antiplatelet therapy over monotherapy in patients with a TIA related to intracranial stenosis due to intracranial atherosclerotic disease. 
(C)

Do not Initiate oral anticoagulation over aspirin, unless there is another formal indication for it, in patients with a TIA due to high-grade stenosis related to intracranial atherosclerotic disease. 
(D)

As per AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines: 
Initiate aspirin 325 mg/day over warfarin to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke and vascular death in patients with a TIA caused by 50-99% stenosis of a major intracranial artery. 
(B)

Consider initiating clopidogrel 75 mg/day, in addition to aspirin, for up to 90 days to further reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with a recent (within 30 days) TIA attributable to severe stenosis (70-99%) of a major intracranial artery. 
(C)

Consider initiating ticagrelor 90 mg BID, in addition to aspirin, for up to 30 days to further reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with a recent (within 24 hours) high-risk TIA and concomitant ipsilateral > 30% stenosis of a major intracranial artery. 
(C)

Consider initiating cilostazol 200 mg/day, in addition to aspirin or clopidogrel, to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with a TIA attributable to 50-99% stenosis of a major intracranial artery. 
(C)

Insufficient evidence to support the use of clopidogrel alone, the combination of aspirin and dipyridamole, ticagrelor alone, or cilostazol alone for secondary stroke prevention in patients with stroke or TIA attributable to 50-99% stenosis of a major intracranial artery. 
(I)

### Antithrombotic therapy, non-cardioembolic TIA:
As per AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines: 
Initiate antiplatelet therapy over oral anticoagulation to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke and other cardiovascular events while minimizing the risk of bleeding in patients with a non-cardioembolic TIA. 
(A)

Initiate aspirin 50-325 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg, or the combination of aspirin 25 mg and extended-release dipyridamole 200 mg BID for secondary prevention of ischemic stroke in patients with a non-cardioembolic TIA. 
(A)

Initiate early dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel), ideally within 12-24 hours of symptom onset and at least within 7 days of onset and continued for 21-90 days, followed by single antiplatelet therapy, to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke in patients with a recent high-risk TIA (ABCD² score ≥ 4). 
(A)

Consider initiating dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor plus aspirin for 30 days to reduce the risk of 30-day recurrent stroke in patients with a high-risk TIA (ABCD² score ≥ 6) and symptomatic intracranial or extracranial ≥ 30% stenosis of an artery that could account for the event, recognizing that it also may increase the risk of serious bleeding events, including Intracerebral hemorrhage. 
(C)

Insufficient evidence regarding the effectiveness of increasing the dose of aspirin or changing to another antiplatelet medication in patients already taking aspirin at the time of a non-cardioembolic TIA. 
(I)

Recognize that the continuous use of dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) for > 90 days or the use of triple antiplatelet therapy is associated with excess risk of bleeding in patients with a non-cardioembolic TIA. 
(B)

As per ESO 2021 guidelines: 
Initiate short-term dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel over monotherapy, subsequently followed by monotherapy, in patients with an acute non-cardioembolic high-risk TIA (ABCD² score of ≥ 4). 
(A)

Do not Initiate dual antiplatelet therapy over monotherapy in patients with an acute non-cardioembolic low-risk TIA or uncertain TIA diagnosis. 
(D)

As per AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines: 
Offer behavior change interventions targeting stroke literacy, lifestyle factors, and medication adherence to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with a TIA. 
(B)

Consider teaching self-management skills or using behavior change theory (such as motivational interviewing) to improve medication adherence in patients with a TIA. 
(C)

Consider offering combined exercise-based and behavior change interventions in preference to behavior interventions alone, exercise interventions alone, or usual care to reduce physiological stroke risk factors, such as SBP, in patients with a TIA. 
(C)

Consider offering targeted secondary prevention programs (such as cardiac rehabilitation programs or exercise and lifestyle counseling programs) to reduce risk factors and recurrent ischemic events in patients with a TIA. 
(C)

Provide health information or advice about stroke prevention in patients with a TIA, recognizing that information or advice alone in the absence of behavioral intervention is not an effective means to change modifiable, lifestyle-related risk factors in order to reduce future ischemic events. 
(B)

## Quality Improvement

### Health equity
As per AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines: 
Assess and address social determinants of health (literacy level, language proficiency, medication affordability, food insecurity, housing, and transportation barriers) when managing stroke risk factors to reduce healthcare disparities. 
(B)

Monitor the achievement of nationally accepted, evidence-based performance measures to identify and address inequities. 
(B)

Adopt the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Universal Precautions Toolkit for Health Literacy to integrate health literacy into the secondary prevention of stroke. 
(B)

Insufficient evidence to recommend an optimal intervention model for improving stroke risk factor control and reducing disparities in patients from urban, predominantly minority, or low-socioeconomic status groups with a TIA.
