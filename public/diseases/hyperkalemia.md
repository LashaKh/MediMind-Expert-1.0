# Hyperkalemia

## Background

### Overview

#### Definition
Hyperkalemia is defined as an increase in serum potassium levels > 5.0 mmol/L.

#### Pathophysiology
The pathophysiology of hyperkalemia involves disruptions in potassium balance due to excess potassium intake, impaired potassium excretion, or transcellular shifts. The etiology is often multifactorial, with impaired renal function, medication use, and hyperglycemia being the most common contributors.

#### Epidemiology
The prevalence of hyperkalemia in the US is estimated at 1,550 per 100,000 population.

#### Disease course
Mild and moderate hyperkalemia are usually asymptomatic. Severe cases may manifest as muscle weakness, ascending paralysis, heart palpitations, and paresthesias. ECG changes associated with hyperkalemia include peaked T waves, P-wave flattening, PR-interval prolongation, widening of the QRS complex, and sine waves.

#### Prognosis and risk of recurrence
The prognosis of hyperkalemia is dependent on the severity of the condition and the promptness of treatment. Severe untreated hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.

- Obtain repeat serum potassium measurement within 1 day of an episode of moderate hyperkalemia (serum potassium 6.0-6.4 mmol/L) when detected in the outpatient setting. (B)
- Admit patients with severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 6.5 mmol/L) detected in the outpatient setting to the hospital for immediate assessment and treatment. (B)

### Indications for monitoring, after initiating RAAS inhibitors
As per UKKA 2023 guidelines:
- Assess urea and electrolytes 1-2 weeks after initiating ACEis or ARBs and after every dose titration. (A)
- Assess urea and electrolytes 1 week after initiating mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists or after dose up-titration, then monthly for the first 3 months, 3-monthly for the first year, and 4-monthly thereafter. (A)

### Confirmatory testing
As per GAIN 2014 guidelines, Obtain a repeat serum potassium urgently in order to exclude pseudohyperkalemia, especially if hyperkalemia is an unexpected or isolated finding. (E)

## Classification and risk stratification

### Severity grading:
As per UKKA 2023 guidelines, Use an early warning scoring system for urgent clinical assessment to assess the level of acuity in all patients presenting to the hospital with known or suspected hyperkalemia. (B)

As per GAIN 2014 guidelines, Classify the severity of hyperkalemia as follows:

| Situation | Guidance |
|-----------|----------|
| **Mild** | Potassium 5.5-5.9 mmol/L |
| **Moderate** | Potassium 6.0-6.5 mmol/L |
| **Severe** | Potassium ≥ 6.5 mmol/L or serum potassium ≥ 5.5mmol/L with ECG changes or symptoms (muscle weakness, flaccid paralysis, palpitations, or paresthesias) |

(E)

## Diagnostic investigations

### History and physical examination:
As per UKKA 2023 guidelines:
- Elicit a comprehensive medical and drug history and perform a clinical examination to determine the cause of hyperkalemia in all patients presenting to the hospital with hyperkalemia. (B)
- Obtain urgent clinical assessment using an early warning scoring system to assess the level of acuity in all patients presenting to the hospital with known or suspected hyperkalemia. (B)

As per GAIN 2014 guidelines:
- Elicit a thorough medical history focusing on a history of renal disease and determination of the medications or fluids prescribed. (E)
- Perform a physical examination for causes of post-renal obstruction, such as bladder distension or prostatic hypertrophy. Catheterize if appropriate. (E)

### Laboratory tests
As per UKKA 2023 guidelines:
- Measure potassium from an arterial or venous blood sample using a point-of-care blood gas analyzer in emergencies whilst awaiting the results from a formal laboratory measurement. (B)
- Use a lithium heparin anticoagulated specimen as the sample type of choice when rapid turnaround of urea and electrolytes results is required. (B)
- Obtain urea and electrolytes using paired lithium heparin and clotted serum samples from a large vein using gentle traction with prompt laboratory analysis if pseudohyperkalemia is suspected. (A)

### ECG:
As per UKKA 2023 guidelines, Obtain an urgent 12-lead ECG and assess for changes of hyperkalemia in all hospitalized patients with serum potassium ≥ 6.0 mmol/L. (B)

- Guide treatment of hyperkalemia in the outpatient setting by its severity and clinical condition of the patient. (B)

### Indications for urgent treatment:
As per AAFP 2023 guidelines, Do not decide on urgent treatment solely based on ECG due to a lack of consistent threshold of ECG changes. (D)

As per UKKA 2023 guidelines:
- Obtain urgent hospital assessment in all patients with severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 6.5 mmol/L) detected in the outpatient setting. (A)
- Consider Obtaining hospital assessment in acutely unwell patients with mild (serum potassium 5.5-5.9 mmol/l) or moderate hyperkalemia (serum potassium 6.0-6.4 mmol/l), particularly in the presence of AKI. (B)
- Use a logical 5-step approach for the treatment of hyperkalemia in the hospital. (B)
- Use a treatment algorithm providing guidance on medical therapies and the need for initiation of RRT in hospitalized patients with hyperkalemia. (B)

As per GAIN 2014 guidelines, Initiate urgent treatment if the serum potassium is ≥ 6.5 mmol/L or hyperkalemia is accompanied by ECG changes or symptoms. (E)

### Discontinuation of contributing medications:
As per UKKA 2023 guidelines:
- Withhold RAAS inhibitors during acute intercurrent illness (such as sepsis, hypovolemia, and/or AKI) at all severities of hyperkalemia. (B)
- Discontinue RAAS inhibitors in patients with serum potassium ≥ 6 mmol/L not meeting the criteria for treatment with patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. (B)

As per GAIN 2014 guidelines:
- Discontinue all medications that can contribute to hyperkalemia, including:
  - ACEis
  - ARBs
  - potassium-retaining diuretics
  - potassium-containing laxatives (E)
- Discontinue β-blockers and digoxin, if safe and feasible, as they prevent intracellular buffering of potassium and reduce the effectiveness of insulin-glucose and β-2 agonists. (E)

### Intravenous calcium:
As per UKKA 2023 guidelines:
- Administer IV calcium (equivalent dose of 6.8 mmol) in patients with hyperkalemia in the presence of ECG changes at a dose and rate of 30 mL 10% calcium gluconate over 10 minutes or 10 mL 10% calcium chloride over 5 minutes guided by the clinical setting. (B)
- Prefer calcium chloride for resuscitation (cardiac arrest or peri-arrest) and calcium gluconate for all other patients in the presence of ECG signs of hyperkalemia. (B)

As per GAIN 2014 guidelines:
- Administer 10 ml of IV calcium gluconate 10% over 2 minutes in patients with hyperkalemia with ECG abnormalities. (E)
- Consider administering additional 10 ml of IV calcium gluconate 10% every 10 minutes if improvement does not occur, until the ECG normalizes. Recognize that patients may require up to 50 ml of IV calcium gluconate and the effect of this intervention is transient (approximately 30-60 minutes). (E)

### Intracellular shifting, insulin/glucose:
As per UKKA 2023 guidelines:
- Administer insulin/glucose (10 units soluble insulin in 25 g glucose) by IV infusion for the treatment of severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 6.5 mmol/L). (B)
- Consider administering insulin/glucose (10 units soluble insulin in 25 g glucose) by IV infusion for the treatment of moderate hyperkalemia (serum potassium 6.0-6.4 mmol/L). (C)
- Administer infusion of 10% glucose at a rate of 50 mL/hour for 5 hours (25 g) following insulin/glucose treatment in patients with a pretreatment blood glucose < 7.0 mmol/L to avoid hypoglycemia. (B)

As per GAIN 2014 guidelines:
- Administer 10 units of rapid-acting insulin combined with 50 mL of 50% glucose solution (25 g of glucose) by slow IV injection over 5 minutes. Recognize that the potassium-lowering effect occurs within 15 minutes and lasts at least 60 minutes, and the reduction in potassium observed ranges from 0.6 to 1.0 mmol/L. (E)
- Consider omitting glucose administration in patients with a baseline serum glucose ≥ 15 mmol/L. (E)
- Monitor urea and electrolyte levels 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after each administration of insulin/glucose. (E)
- Monitor blood glucose 15 and 30 minutes after starting the infusion, and then hourly up to 6 hours after completion of the infusion, as delayed hypoglycemia is commonly reported when < 30 g of glucose is administered with insulin. (E)
- Recognize that capillary glucose testing with a glucometer may not provide an accurate or reliable measure of blood glucose in some circumstances (such as circulatory shock, diabetic ketoacidosis). Obtain a venous blood sample analysis in these circumstances or if the glucose level measured by capillary testing does not correspond with the clinical picture. Consider testing a drop of blood from the venous sample using the glucometer to assess if a discrepancy exists with the capillary measurement. Confirm if the glucometer is properly calibrated based on the comparison of the venous sample with the laboratory sample. (E)

### Intracellular shifting, salbutamol:
As per UKKA 2023 guidelines:
- Administer nebulized salbutamol 10-20 mg as adjuvant therapy in patients with severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 6.5 mmol/L). (B)
- Consider administering nebulized salbutamol 10-20 mg as adjuvant therapy in patients with moderate hyperkalemia (serum potassium 6.0-6.4 mmol/L). (C)
- Do not use salbutamol as monotherapy in the treatment of severe hyperkalemia. (D)

As per GAIN 2014 guidelines:
- Administer salbutamol (10 mg via nebulisation). Potassium-lowering effects occur within 15-30 minutes and lasts at least 2 hours. The reduction in potassium observed ranges from 0.5 to 1.0 mmol/L. (E)
- Avoid using salbutamol as a single agent for the treatment of hyperkalemia, as it may not lower potassium in all patients. Response is weakened in patients taking β-blockers, digoxin, and in patients on chronic dialysis. (D)

### Intracellular shifting, sodium bicarbonate:
As per UKKA 2023 guidelines:
- Administer sodium bicarbonate in non-hospitalized patients with CKD with a serum bicarbonate level < 22 mmol/L with or without hyperkalemia. (B)
- Avoid using sodium bicarbonate IV infusion routinely for acute treatment of hyperkalemia. (D)

As per GAIN 2014 guidelines, Consider not using hypertonic sodium bicarbonate as a treatment for hyperkalemia, as many studies show that sodium bicarbonate fails to lower the serum potassium. (D)

### Gastrointestinal excretion, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate:
As per AAFP 2023 guidelines, prefer sodium zirconium cyclosilicate over sodium polystyrene sulfonate in patients with hyperkalemia due to higher efficacy and lower risk of serious adverse effects. (B)

### Gastrointestinal excretion, patiromer:
As per AAFP 2023 guidelines, prefer patiromer over sodium polystyrene sulfonate in patients with hyperkalemia due to higher efficacy and lower risk of serious adverse effects. (B)

As per UKKA 2023 guidelines:
- Administer patiromer as an option for the management of persistent hyperkalemia with a confirmed serum potassium ≥ 6.0 mmol/L in adult patients with CKD stage 3b-5 (not on dialysis) or HF receiving a suboptimal dose or not receiving RAAS inhibitors due to hyperkalemia. Start patiromer only in secondary care. (A)
- Discontinue patiromer if RAAS inhibitors are stopped. (A)
- Consider administering patiromer as an option for emergency management of acute hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 6.0 mmol/L). (B)

- Monitor blood glucose at regular intervals (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 minutes) after administration of insulin/glucose infusion in all patients with hyperkalemia. (B)
- Arrange outpatient blood monitoring on discharge of patients who have required treatment for hyperkalemia during hospital admission. (B)

As per GAIN 2014 guidelines, monitor urea, electrolytes and glucose at regular intervals. Consider additional blood investigations, including blood gas analysis, as appropriate. (E)

### Cardiac monitoring:
As per UKKA 2023 guidelines, Obtain a minimum of continuous 3-lead ECG monitoring, ideally in a higher-dependency setting, in all patients with serum potassium ≥ 6.5 mmol/L, patients with features of hyperkalemia on 12-lead ECG, and in patients with a serum potassium of 6.0-6.4 mmol/L who are clinically unwell or in whom a rapid increase in serum potassium is anticipated. (B)

As per GAIN 2014 guidelines:
