| Low risk | Initiate anticancer therapy without delay (B) |
| Moderate risk | Consider referring to a cardiologist before initiating anticancer therapy (B) |
| High and very high risk | Refer to a cardiologist before initiating anticancer therapy<br>Discuss the risk/benefit balance of cardiotoxic anticancer treatment in a multidisciplinary approach before initiating treatment (B) |

- Refer patients with cancer and preexisting CVD or abnormal findings at baseline cardiovascular toxicity risk assessment requiring potentially cardiotoxic anticancer therapy to a cardiologist. (B)

## Diagnostic Investigations

### Cardiovascular Assessment

**As per EHA/ESC/ESTRO/IC-OS 2022 guidelines:**
- Obtain a specialist cardiovascular assessment for optimal diagnostic workup and management in patients with cancer presenting with new cardiovascular toxicity during and after cancer treatment. (B)

**As per ESMO 2020 guidelines:**
- Screen for known cardiovascular risk factors in patients with cancer. Treat identified cardiovascular risk factors according to current guidelines. (A)
- Monitor cardiovascular safety during cancer therapy, especially mediastinal and left-sided chest radiation and certain chemotherapy and targeted agents, as they can substantially affect the heart and vascular system. (A)
- Obtain cardiology consultation, preferably with a cardio-oncology specialist, for asymptomatic patients receiving cardiotoxic anticancer therapy and having elevations in cardiac troponin levels. (B)

### ECG

**As per EHA/ESC/ESTRO/IC-OS 2022 guidelines:**
- Obtain an ECG as part of the baseline cardiovascular risk assessment in all patients initiating cancer therapy. Refer patients with an abnormal baseline ECG to a cardiologist. (B)

**As per ESMO 2020 guidelines:**
- Obtain a baseline ECG including measurement of HR QTc in patients requiring treatment with a potentially cardiotoxic treatment. (A)

**As per CCS 2016 guidelines:**
- Consider obtaining a baseline ECG before initiating QTc-prolonging agents, and periodically during treatment. (C)

### Cardiac Imaging

**As per EHA/ESC/ESTRO/IC-OS 2022 guidelines:**

- Obtain echocardiography as the first-line modality for the assessment of cardiac function in patients with cancer. (B)

  - Obtain highly reproducible, quantitative volumetric, non-irradiating imaging, such as quantitative 2D/3D echocardiography and cardiac MRI, with quality control (A)
  - Obtain the same imaging modality at the same facility for serial testing in each patient (A)
  - Consider obtaining LV global longitudinal strain imaging when available for baseline and serial monitoring of LV systolic function (B)
