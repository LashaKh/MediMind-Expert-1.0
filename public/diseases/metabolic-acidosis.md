# Metabolic Acidosis


## Guidelines

### Key Sources
The following summarized guidelines for the evaluation and management of metabolic acidosis are prepared by our editorial team based on guidelines from the French Society of Emergency Medicine (SFMU/SRLF 2019).

## Studies

### 2018 • BICAR-ICU Study
In adult patients admitted to the ICU within 48 hours experiencing severe acidemia and a total SOFA score ≥ 4 or an arterial lactate concentration ≥ 2 mmol/L, bicarbonate was not superior to control with respect to death from any cause by day 28 and the presence of at least one organ failure at day 7.

## Diagnostic Investigations

### Laboratory Testing
As per SFMU/SRLF 2019 guidelines:

**Consider obtaining arterial blood gas measurement** in patients with decreased plasma bicarbonate level in order to:
- eliminate respiratory alkalosis
- confirm the diagnosis of metabolic acidosis
- test for mixed acidosis  
(E)

**Avoid measuring base deficit** rather than plasma bicarbonate for identifying patients at risk of metabolic acidosis.  
(D)

**Consider using anion gap corrected for albumin** rather than uncorrected anion gap to differentiate acidosis related to acid load from acidosis related to base deficit.  
(C)

**Consider applying the Henderson-Hasselbalch method** using anion gap corrected for albumin first for the diagnosis of the mechanism of metabolic acidosis. Recognize that the Stewart method provides insight into situations unexplained by the Henderson-Hasselbalch method: acid-base imbalance secondary to blood sodium and chloride imbalance and complex disorders.  
(E)

**Consider using an algorithm** to improve the etiological diagnosis of metabolic acidosis.  
(E)

**Consider calculating anion gap** only in patients with metabolic acidosis without unmeasured anions or obvious etiology.  
(E)

**Consider measuring urinary pH** only in patients with metabolic acidosis without unmeasured anions or obvious etiology, and with a strong clinical suspicion of tubular acidosis.  
(E)

**Recognize that a normal value of venous lactate** discounts hyperlactatemia.  
(E)

**Consider measuring arterial lactate** to confirm hyperlactatemia in patients with increased venous lactate.  
(C)

**Do not measure capillary blood lactate** for the diagnosis of hyperlactatemia.  
(D)

**Measure capillary blood ketones** rather than urine ketones for the diagnosis of ketoacidosis.  
(A)

**Avoid using pH value alone** to identify critically ill patients.  
(D)

**Regard hyperlactatemia, whatever its value,** as a marker of severity in initial treatment. Ensure rapid and multidisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic management if needed.  
(A)

## Respiratory Support

### Mechanical Ventilation
As per SFMU/SRLF 2019 guidelines:

**Consider increasing respiratory frequency** without inducing intrinsic PEEP, with a maximum of 35 cycles/min and/or a tidal volume up to 8 mL/kg of body mass, and by monitoring plateau pressure for compensating acidemia.  
(E)

**Recognize that the aim of ventilation is not to normalize pH.** Consider targeting pH ≥ 7.15.  
(E)

**Ensure concomitant medical treatment** of metabolic acidosis and of its cause, as ventilatory compensation can only be symptomatic and temporary.  
(E)

## Medical Management

### Sodium Bicarbonate
As per SFMU/SRLF 2019 guidelines:

**Consider administering sodium bicarbonate** to compensate for gastrointestinal or renal base loss in patients with poor clinical tolerance.  
(E)

**Consider administering sodium bicarbonate** in intensive care patients with severe metabolic acidemia (pH ≤ 7.20, PaCO2 < 45 mmHg) and moderate-to-severe acute renal insufficiency.  
(C)

**Do not administer routine sodium bicarbonate** for the management of patients with circulatory arrest, apart from preexisting hyperkalemia or poisoning by membrane stabilizers.  
(D)

**Avoid administering sodium bicarbonate** in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis.  
(D)

**Consider administering sodium bicarbonate** for the management of patients with salicylate poisoning, regardless of pH value.  
(E)

### Insulin
As per SFMU/SRLF 2019 guidelines:

**Consider administering insulin IV** rather than SC in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis.  
(C)

**Avoid administering insulin bolus** before starting continuous IV insulin therapy in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis.  
(D)

**Consider administering low continuous IV insulin doses** for the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis.  
(C)

**Consider administering initial doses of insulin** at 0.1 IU/kg/hour without exceeding 10 IU/hour, and increasing it in the absence of hypokalemia, if the targets for correction of blood ketones (0.5 mmol/L/hour), bicarbonate (3 mmol/L/hour), and capillary blood glucose (3 mmol/L/hour) are not reached after the first hours of treatment.  
(E)

## Inpatient Care

### Inpatient Monitoring
As per SFMU/SRLF 2019 guidelines:

**Consider monitoring the increase in blood lactate levels** in the first hours of management to assess the response to treatment.  
(C)

**Consider obtaining close monitoring** in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, ideally in an ICU setting.  
(E)

## Therapeutic Procedures

### RRT (Renal Replacement Therapy)
As per SFMU/SRLF 2019 guidelines:

**Consider performing RRT** in patients with shock and/or acute renal insufficiency if the pH ≤ 7.15 in the absence of severe respiratory acidosis and despite appropriate treatment.  
(E)

**Consider performing early RRT** in patients with lactic acidosis suggestive of metformin poisoning if there is an organ dysfunction or in the absence of improvement in the first hours of therapeutic management.  
(E)

**Consider performing RRT** in patients with methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning if the anion gap > 20 mEq/L or if there is renal insufficiency or visual impairment.  
(E)

**Consider performing RRT** in patients with metabolic acidosis associated with salicylic acid poisoning if there is neurological involvement and/or if the salicylic acid concentration > 6.5 mmol/L (90 mg/dL) and/or if the pH ≤ 7.20.  
(E)
