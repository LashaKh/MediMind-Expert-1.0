## Screening and Diagnosis

### Prenatal Diagnosis
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines, **obtain an obstetrical fetal anomaly scan** at 18-22 weeks of gestation. Include at minimum a four-chamber view, outflow tract views, and three-vessel tracheal view in the cardiac imaging during obstetrical fetal anomaly scan.  
 (B)

### Postnatal Diagnosis
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines:

**Obtain TTE** to rule out congenital heart disease, including HLHS, in undiagnosed neonates with persistent tachypnea or desaturation.  
 (B)

**Assess global cardiac function, structures** by four-chamber view, outflow tract views, aortic arch, coeliac trunk, and cerebral blood flow.  
 (B)

**Confirm the diagnosis of HLHS** by a pediatric cardiologist and provide counseling to the parents in conjunction with a pediatric cardiac surgeon.  
 (B)

## Diagnostic Investigations

### Cardiac Imaging
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines, **Obtain echocardiographic evaluation** of HLHS to define the HLHS type, including the situs and cardiac variants, and assess the left ventricle and its function, ventricular septal defect, atrial septum, pulmonary veins (anatomy and Doppler flow patterns), aortic arch including flow patterns (antegrade, retrograde), RV function, and tricuspid valve. **Obtain cardiac MRI** as the standard for measurement of right ventricle volume and function.  
 (B)

### ECG
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines, **Obtain an ECG** to exclude cardiac arrhythmias.  
 (B)

### CXR
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines, **Obtain CXR** by clinical indication only.  
 (B)

### Genetic Testing
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines, **Obtain testing for chromosomal abnormalities** in patients with extracardiac abnormalities to provide additional information for postnatal counseling and prognosis.  
 (B)

## Medical Management

### Setting of Delivery
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines, **Allow delivery of a fetus with HLHS**, in the absence of risk factors, to occur spontaneously up to 40 weeks. **Offer elective delivery planning** (induction of labor or Cesarean delivery) no earlier than 39 weeks as long as there are no obstetrical risk factors.  
 (B)

### Initial Resuscitation
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines:

**Perform resuscitation**, Including intubation and ventilation and placement of central and invasive monitoring lines, in unstable neonates.  
 (B)

**Administer oxygen and perform intubation and ventilation** only by strict indications.  
 (B)

**Ensure minimal handling** in a tranquil environment with HR, respiratory rate, SaO2, and BP monitoring in stable neonates.  
 (B)

### Prostaglandin E1
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines, **Administer continuous, low-dose prostaglandin E1 infusion** to preserve patency of the ductus arteriosus before stage I procedure.  
 (B)

### Hemodynamic Support
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines, **Administer inodilators (milrinone)** to support RV function before stage I procedure, if adequate coronary perfusion pressure is maintained.  
 (B)

## Perioperative Care

### Preoperative Imaging
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines, **Obtain TTE** for planning initial surgery in patients with classical HLHS. **Consider obtaining 3D echocardiography** to assist in imaging the tricuspid valve to assess morphology and regurgitation.  
 (B)

### Intraoperative Imaging
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines, **Obtain intraoperative transesophageal or epicardial echocardiography** in conjunction with hemodynamic assessment during the Norwood procedure. **Consider obtaining exit angiography or CT** for clinical concerns, particularly for anatomy less accessible to echocardiography.  
 (B)

### Postoperative Imaging
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines, **Obtain TTE** as the initial imaging modality for postoperative assessment including all operated regions (atrial communication, neoaortic valve, aortic-pulmonary artery connection, coronary flow, arch reconstruction, source of pulmonary blood flow, and branch pulmonary arteries after the Norwood procedure, and atrial communication, ductus arteriosus stent, aortic arch flow, bilateral pulmonary artery banding after the hybrid procedure). **Consider obtaining angiography or CT** for clinical concerns unanswered by echocardiography.  
 (B)

## Surgical Interventions

### Prenatal Interventions
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines:

**Consider performing fetal intervention** to augment the size of the atrial septal communication to improve perinatal and longer-term outcomes in the fetus with a restrictive foramen ovale.  
(C)

**Consider performing fetal intervention** to improve antegrade flow across the aortic valve in an effort to achieve a biventricular outcome in fetuses with critical aortic stenosis and features of emerging HLHS.  
(C)

### Immediate Postnatal Interventions
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines, **Consider performing immediate transcatheter or surgical intervention** in neonates with HLHS and restrictive ductus arteriosus, restrictive foramen ovale, totally anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, pulmonary valve stenosis, or non-restrictive foramen ovale with high pulmonary blood flow.  
(C)

### Pre-stage 1 Interventions
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines:

**Perform balloon atrial septostomy** to treat pulmonary congestion and to increase pulmonary blood flow in cases of insufficient inter-circulatory mixing.  
 (B)

**Perform bilateral pulmonary banding** for low cardiac output based on a high pulmonary blood flow and widely patent ductus arteriosus.  
 (B)

### Norwood Stage 1 Palliation
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines, Use the following techniques for the management of pulmonary arteries:
- **patch reconstruction of the central pulmonary arteries**  (B)
- **direct closure of the central pulmonary arteries**  (B)
- **division of the branch pulmonary arteries**  (B)
- **ligature of the proximal ductus arteriosus, no patch**  (B)

### Hybrid Stage 1 Palliation
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines, **Perform hybrid stage 1 palliation** electively in the first postnatal week.  
 (B)

### Considerations for Anesthesia
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines, **Peduce systemic vascular resistance** and prevent surges in afterload to improve systemic perfusion and maintain a balanced pulmonary blood flow/systemic blood flow.  
 (B)

## Specific Circumstances

### Patients with Tricuspid Regurgitation
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines, **Recognize that tricuspid regurgitation** moderately increases mortality and morbidity rates and prevents completion of the single ventricle pathway.  
 (B)

### Patients with Restrictive Atrial Septal Defect
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines, **Recognize that intact atrial septum or restrictive foramen ovale** are predictors of poor outcome in HLHS.  
 (B)

### Patients with Pulmonary Vein Anomalies
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines, **Perform surgery as early as possible** in patients with anomalies of pulmonary venous connection with obstruction. **Repair the anomalous connection** by anastomosis between the common pulmonary vein and the most convenient part of the common atrium.  
 (B)

### Patients with Coronary Anomalies
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines:

**Recognize that coronary anomalies** can negatively impact survival after stage 1 palliation. **Obtain preoperative echocardiographic evaluation** if a coronary anomaly is suspected.  
 (B)

**Use a particular strategy** for stage 1 palliation in patients with aortic atresia/MS associated with a ventriculocoronary connection as it is associated with a higher mortality rate.  
 (B)

## Follow-up and Surveillance

### Early Postoperative Care
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines, **Ensure compliance with an operating room checklist** and a rigorous handover to the ICU team based on an algorithm.  
(A)vidence Level:** (A)

### Interstage 1 Monitoring
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines, Include the following components in the interstage 1 monitoring programs:
- **dedicated interstage 1 care team**  (B)
- **interstage 1 clinic**  (B)
- **provision of red flag action plan**  (B)
- **standardized discharge process** including family education and rooming in  (B)

- **use of tablet or mobile apps**  (B)

As per AHA 2018 guidelines, **Consider providing a home monitoring program** including the following components for the interstage period to reduce interstage morbidity and mortality:
- daily oxygen saturations
- daily weights
- diet record
- close communication with discharging facility  
(C)

## Quality Improvement

### Analysis of Outcomes
As per AEPC/EACTS 2020 guidelines:

**Use the International Paediatric and Congenital Cardiac Code** in all registries, databases, and research studies in pediatric and congenital cardiac care, including cases of HLHS.  
 (B)

**Ensure that all pediatric and congenital cardiac teams** routinely assess their data against national and international benchmarks using multi-institutional databases and registries.
