## Studies

### CLEAR Outcomes Study (2023)
The [CLEAR Outcomes study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36876740/) demonstrated that in patients who were unable or unwilling to take statins owing to unacceptable adverse effects and had or were at high risk for CVD, bempedoic acid was superior to placebo with respect to major adverse cardiovascular events.

## Screening and Diagnosis

### Screening for Adverse Effects

AS per AAPA/ABC/ACC/…/PCNA 2019 guidelines: Assess appropriate safety indicators 4-12 weeks after statin initiation or dose adjustment and every 3-12 months thereafter based on the need to assess safety. (A)

AS per CCS 2016 guidelines: Assess all purported statin-associated symptoms systematically, incorporating observation during cessation and reinitiation (same or different statin, same or lower potency, same or decreased frequency of dosing), to identify a tolerated, statin-based therapy for chronic use.  (B)

AS per ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines: Do not measure CK levels routinely in patients on statin therapy. (D)

## Diagnostic Investigations

### Clinical Assessment

AS per AAPA/ABC/ACC/…/PCNA 2019 guidelines: Obtain a thorough assessment of symptoms in patients with statin-associated muscle symptoms, in addition to an evaluation for non-statin causes and predisposing factors. (A)

AS per ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines: Consider evaluating for non-statin causes (such as exposure to other drugs, systemic or neuropsychiatric causes), in addition to the possibility of adverse effects associated with statin drug therapy, in patients presenting with a confusional state or memory impairment while on statin therapy. (C)

### Laboratory Tests

AS per AAPA/ABC/ACC/…/PCNA 2019 guidelines: Measure CK levels in patients with severe statin-associated muscle symptoms and objective muscle weakness. Measure liver transaminases (AST, ALT), TBIL, and ALP in patients with symptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity.  (B)

AS per ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines:

- Consider measuring CK levels in patients with muscle symptoms, including pain, tenderness, stiffness, cramping, weakness, or generalized fatigue, occurring during statin therapy. (C)

- Measure CK and creatinine levels and obtain urinalysis for myoglobinuria to evaluate for rhabdomyolysis in patients with unexplained severe muscle symptoms or fatigue occurring during statin therapy.  (B)

- Consider obtaining LFTs in patients with symptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity (such as unusual fatigue or weakness, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, dark-colored urine, or yellowing of the skin or sclera) arising during statin therapy. (C)

- Obtain evaluation for other conditions increasing the risk for muscle symptoms (such as hypothyroidism, reduced renal or hepatic function, rheumatologic disorders such as polymyalgia rheumatica, corticosteroid myopathy, vitamin D deficiency, or primary muscle diseases) in patients with mild-to-moderate muscle symptoms occurring during statin therapy. (B)

- Obtain evaluation for new-onset diabetes in patients on statin therapy according to the current diabetes screening guidelines.  (B)

## Medical Management

### Treatment Modifications

As per AAPA/ABC/ACC/…/PCNA 2019 guidelines:

- Switch to moderate-intensity statin therapy with the aim of achieving a 30-49% reduction in LDL-C levels in patients with clinical ASCVD experiencing statin-associated side effects on high-intensity statin therapy. (A)

- Obtain reassessment in patients with non-severe statin-associated side effects and offer a rechallenge to achieve a maximal LDL-C reduction by modified dosing regimen, an alternate statin, or in combination with non-statin therapy.  (B)

- Consider adding a non-statin drug (ezetimibe or bile acid sequestrant) to moderate-intensity statin therapy in intermediate-risk adult patients requiring more aggressive LDL-C reduction but not tolerating high-intensity statin therapy. (C)

- Consider switching to non-statin therapy likely to provide net clinical benefit in patients at increased ASCVD risk with severe statin-associated muscle symptoms or recurrent statin-associated muscle symptoms despite appropriate statin rechallenge. (C)

As per ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines: Consider managing muscle symptoms, including pain, tenderness, stiffness, cramping, weakness, or fatigue, in statin-treated patients according to the following management strategy:

| Situation | Guidance |
|-----------|----------|
| **Severe symptoms** | Discontinue statins promptly in patients developing unexplained severe muscle symptoms or fatigue, and obtain an evaluation for rhabdomyolysis |
| **Resolving mild-to-moderate symptoms** | Discontinue statins until the symptoms can be evaluated in patients developing mild-to-moderate muscle symptoms<br><br>Resume the original or a lower dose of the same statin, if not contraindicated, to establish a causal relationship between muscle symptoms and statin therapy if mild-to-moderate symptoms resolve after statin discontinuation<br><br>Discontinue the original statin if a causal relationship exists<br><br>Switch to a low dose of a different statin once muscle symptoms resolve<br><br>Increase the dose gradually as tolerated once low-dose statin is tolerated |
| **Non-resolving mild-to-moderate symptoms** | Consider evaluating for other causes of muscle symptoms if muscle symptoms or elevated CK levels do not resolve completely after 2 months without statin treatment |
| **Non-statin causes** | Resume statin therapy at the original dose if persistent muscle symptoms are determined to arise from a condition unrelated to statin therapy or if the predisposing condition has been treated |

(C)

## Specific Circumstances

### Patients with Chronic Liver Disease

As per Baveno VII 2022 guidelines:

- Prescribe statins at a lower dose (such as simvastatin at a maximum of 20 mg/day) in patients with Child-Pugh B and C cirrhosis, and obtain close monitoring for muscle and liver toxicity. (A)

- Restrict the use of statins in patients with Child-Pugh C cirrhosis since their benefit in these patients has not been proven yet.  (B)

As per AAPA/ABC/ACC/…/PCNA 2019 guidelines: Consider obtaining baseline measurements and determining a schedule of monitoring and safety checks before initiating statins in patients at increased ASCVD risk with chronic, stable liver disease (including MASLD).  (B)

## Preventative Measures

### Pretreatment Assessment

As per AAPA/ABC/ACC/…/PCNA 2019 guidelines:

- Conduct a clinician-patient risk discussion before initiating statin therapy to review net clinical benefit, weighing the potential for ASCVD risk reduction against the potential for statin-associated side effects, drug-drug interactions, and safety while emphasizing that side effects can be addressed successfully, (A) as well mote shared decision-making taking into account patient preferences.  (B)

- Identify potential predisposing factors for statin-associated side effects, including new-onset diabetes mellitus and statin-associated muscle symptoms, before initiating statin therapy.  (B)

As per ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines:

- Elicit a history of prior or current muscle symptoms to establish a baseline before initiating statin therapy.  (B)

- Decide on the choice of the appropriate statin and dose based on patient characteristics, level of ASCVD risk, and potential for adverse effects, in order to maximize the safety of statins. Offer moderate-intensity statin therapy in patients otherwise requiring high-intensity statin therapy in the presence of characteristics predisposing them to statin-associated adverse effects. Recognize that characteristics predisposing patients to statin adverse effects include but are not limited to:
  - multiple or serious comorbidities, including impaired renal or hepatic function
  - history of previous statin intolerance or muscle disorders
  - unexplained ALT elevations ≥ 3 times the ULN
  - patient characteristics or concomitant use of drugs affecting statin metabolism
  - age > 75 years  (B)

- Recognize that additional characteristics, such as a history of hemorrhagic stroke or Asian ancestry, can also modify the decision to use higher statin intensities.  (B)

- Consider obtaining baseline measurement of CK levels in patients at increased risk for adverse muscle events because of a personal or family history of statin intolerance or muscle disease, clinical presentation, or concomitant drug therapy increasing the risk of myopathy. (C)

- Obtain baseline measurement of hepatic transaminase levels before initiating statin therapy.  (B)
