# Mitral Regurgitation

## Background

### Definition
MR is a form of structural heart disease characterized by abnormal systolic flow of blood across the mitral valve, from the left ventricle to the left atrium.

### Pathophysiology
Mechanisms of MR can broadly be classified into primary causes and secondary causes. Patients with primary MR are grouped according to the Carpentier classification (type 1 MR: normal leaflet size and motion; type 2 MR: excessive leaflet motion; type 3a MR: leaflet restriction in diastole; type 3b: leaflet restriction in systole).

### Epidemiology
The prevalence of MR in the US is estimated at 1,700 patients per 100,000 population.

### Prognosis and Risk of Recurrence
Significant MR is associated with an adjusted hazard ratio for mortality of 1.83 (95% CI 1.28 to 2.62, p < 0.001) as compared with matched controls.

## Guidelines

## Diagnostic Investigations

### TTE
As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines:
- **Obtain a TTE for baseline evaluation** of LV size and function, RV function, LA size, pulmonary artery pressure, and the mechanism and severity of primary MR (stages A to D) in patients with known or suspected primary MR.  (B)
- **Consider obtaining novel measurements** of LV function (such as global longitudinal strain) as an adjunct to guide the timing of intervention in asymptomatic patients with severe primary MR (stages B and C1). (C)
- **Obtain a TTE to evaluate** the mitral valve apparatus and LV function in patients with primary MR (stages B to D) and new-onset or changing symptoms.  (B)
- **Obtain a TTE to establish** the etiology and to assess the extent of regional and global LV remodeling and systolic dysfunction, the severity of MR, and magnitude of pulmonary hypertension in patients with chronic secondary MR (stages B to D).  (B)

### TEE
As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines:
- **Obtain a TEE to evaluate** the severity of MR, mechanism of MR, and status of LV function (stages B to D) in patients with primary MR if TTE provides insufficient or discordant information.  (B)
- **Obtain a TEE to determine** suitability for mitral valve intervention in patients with chronic secondary MR with severe symptoms (stage D) unresponsive to guideline-directed medical therapy and eligible for transcatheter mitral valve interventions.  (B)

### Exercise Stress Testing
As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines, **consider obtaining hemodynamic exercise testing** using Doppler echocardiography or cardiopulmonary exercise testing in patients with primary MR (stages B and C) and symptoms likely attributable to MR. (C)

### Cardiac MRI
As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines, **obtain cardiac MRI** is indicated to assess LV and RV volumes and function in patients with primary MR, as well as to help assess MR severity when there is a discrepancy between the findings on clinical assessment and echocardiography.  (B)

### Cardiac Biomarkers
As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines, **consider obtaining serum biomarkers** as an adjunct to guide the timing of intervention in asymptomatic patients with severe primary MR (stages B and C1). (C)

### Diagnostic Procedures
As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines,
**Cardiac catheterization:**  consider performing cardiac catheterization in patients with primary MR (stages B and C) and symptoms likely attributable to MR. (C)

## Medical Management

### Management of Systolic Dysfunction
As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines:
- **Consider initiating guideline-directed medical therapy** for systolic dysfunction in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with severe primary MR and LV systolic dysfunction (stages C2 and D) if surgery is not possible or must be delayed. (C)
- **Initiate standard guideline-directed medical therapy** for HF, including ACEis, ARBs, β-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and/or sacubitril/valsartan, and biventricular pacing, in patients with chronic severe secondary MR (stages C and D) and HF with reduced LVEF. (A)

### Antihypertensive Therapy
As per ESC 2024 guidelines, **Consider initiating renin-angiotensin system blockers** as part of treatment in patients with a history of moderate-to-severe mitral valve regurgitation requiring BP-lowering treatment. (C)
As per ESH 2023 guidelines, **Initiate antihypertensive therapy** to prevent mitral insufficiency and to reduce symptoms of mitral insufficiency through reduced afterload of the left ventricle.  (B)

### Vasodilator Therapy
As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines, **Do not administer vasodilators** in asymptomatic patients with primary MR and normal LV systolic function (stages B and C1) and normal BP. (D)

## Perioperative Care

### Intraoperative Imaging
As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines:
- **Obtain intraoperative TEE** to establish the anatomic basis for primary MR (Stages C and D) and to guide repair in patients with severe primary MR undergoing mitral intervention.  (B)
- **Obtain intraprocedural TEE** for guidance in patients with chronic secondary MR undergoing transcatheter mitral valve intervention.  (B)

As per ACC/AHA 2021 Guidelines:
- **Perform mitral valve intervention** in symptomatic patients with severe primary MR (stage D), irrespective of LV systolic function.  (B)
- **Perform mitral valve repair** in preference to mitral valve replacement in patients with degenerative disease-related severe primary MR if a successful and durable repair is possible.  (B)

### Mitral Valve Repair, Primary MR, Asymptomatic Patients

As per EACTS/ESC 2022 Guidelines:
- **Perform surgery** in asymptomatic patients with LV dysfunction (LVESD ≥ 40 mm and/or LVEF ≤ 60%).  (B)
