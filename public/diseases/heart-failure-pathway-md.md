## Background

### Overview

#### **Definition**

HF is a clinical syndrome that results from structural or functional impairment of filling or ejection of blood from the heart. HF can be associated with either reduced ejection fraction (≤ 40%), preserved ejection fraction (≥ 50%), or borderline ejection fraction (41-50%).

#### **Pathophysiology**

The most common causes of HF include ischemic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, valvular and rheumatic heart disease, genetic cardiomyopathies, and congenital heart disease.

#### **Epidemiology**
In the US, the age and sex-adjusted incidence of HF is estimated at 219.3 cases per 100,000 person-years. Its prevalence is estimated at 1915 persons per 100,000 population.

#### **Disease course**
Clinical manifestations relate to pulmonary edema (dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea), peripheral edema (ankle swelling, abdominal bloating), and activation of inflammatory pathways (early satiety, cachexia). Severe HF leads to manifestations related to hypoperfusion, spanning from mild fatigue and exertional intolerance to cardiogenic shock.

#### **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**
The 1-year and 5-year mortality associated with HF are estimated at 20.2% and 56.2%, respectively. Death is due to non-cardiovascular events in over 50% of patients.
