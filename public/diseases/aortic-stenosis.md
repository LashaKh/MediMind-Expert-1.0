# Aortic Stenosis

## Background

### Overview

#### **Definition**  
AS is a chronic fibrocalcific disease that results in narrowing of the aortic valve.

#### **Pathophysiology**  
AS is caused by the interplay of structural (e.g., bicuspid aortic valve), hereditary (e.g., genetic polymorphisms of lipoprotein A gene), and acquired (e.g., progressive age-related calcification, rheumatic valve disease) factors. Turbulent flow through a stenotic aortic valve causes endothelial damage, with subsequent subendothelial inflammation and accumulation of oxidized lipoproteins, and leads to deposition of calcium on the valve with progression of stenosis.

#### **Epidemiology**  
The prevalence of AS in the US is estimated at 400 persons per 100,000 population. The incidence of AS-related admissions in the US is estimated at 9.5-26 cases per 100,000 patient-years.

#### **Disease course**  
AS results in obstruction to the ejection of blood the left ventricle, with resultant signs and symptoms of left-sided HF.

#### **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**  
The overall survival of elderly patients with severe AS is 3 years from the onset of symptoms. In patients with severe, symptomatic AS who are at prohibitive risk for aortic valve replacement, the 1-year and 5-year mortality rates are 50% and > 90%, respectively.

## Diagnostic Investigations

### TTE
**As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines:**

(A) : Obtain TTE for accurate diagnosis of the cause of AS, assessment of hemodynamic severity, measurement of LV size and systolic function, and determination of prognosis and timing of valve intervention in patients with signs or symptoms of AS.

(C) : Consider calculating the ratio of the outflow tract to aortic velocity to further define severity in patients with suspected low-flow, low-gradient severe AS with normal or reduced LVEF (stages D2-D3).

### Dobutamine Stress Testing
**As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines:**

(C) : Consider obtaining low-dose dobutamine stress testing with echocardiographic or invasive hemodynamic measurements to further define severity and assess contractile reserve in patients with suspected low-flow, low-gradient severe AS with reduced LVEF (stage D2).

### Exercise Stress Testing
**As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines:**

(C) : Consider obtaining exercise testing to assess physiological changes with exercise and to confirm the absence of symptoms in asymptomatic patients with severe AS (stage C1).

(D) : Do not obtain exercise testing in symptomatic patients with severe AS (stage D1, aortic velocity ≥ 4.0 m/s or mean pressure gradient ≥ 40 mmHg) because of the risk of severe hemodynamic compromise.

### Cardiac CT
**As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines:**

(C) : Consider obtaining CT for the measurement of aortic valve calcium score to further define severity in patients with suspected low-flow, low-gradient severe AS with normal or reduced LVEF (stages D2 and D3).

## Diagnostic Procedures

### Coronary Angiography
**As per EACTS/ESC 2022 guidelines:**

(B) : Obtain coronary angiography before valve surgery in patients with severe valvular heart disease and any of the following:
- history of CVD
- suspected myocardial ischemia
- LV systolic dysfunction
- age > 40 for males
- postmenopause
- ≥ 1 cardiovascular risk factors

(C) : Consider obtaining coronary CTA as an alternative to coronary angiography before valve surgery in patients with severe valvular heart disease and low probability of coronary artery disease.

## Medical Management

### Antihypertensive Therapy

**As per ESC 2024 guidelines:**
(C) : Consider initiating renin-angiotensin system blockers as part of treatment in patients with a history of aortic valve stenosis requiring BP-lowering treatment.

**As per ESH 2023 guidelines:**
(B) : Use the same BP thresholds, targets, and drug treatment strategies in patients with AS as for the general population with hypertension.
(B) : Lower BP more cautiously to avoid an excessive fall in BP and recurrent syncope in patients with high-grade AS, particularly with a history of syncope.

**As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines:**
(B) : Ensure optimization of BP control before measurement of AS severity by TTE, TEE, cardiac catheterization, or cardiac magnetic resonance in patients with suspected low-flow, low-gradient severe AS with normal LVEF (stage D3).
(B) : Initiate antihypertensive therapy according to standard guideline-directed medical therapy, started at a low dose, and gradually titrated upward as needed, with appropriate clinical monitoring in patients at risk of developing AS (stage A) and in patients with asymptomatic AS (stages B and C).
(C) : Consider administering RAAS blockers (ACEis or ARBs) to reduce the long-term risk of all-cause mortality in patients undergoing TAVI.

#### Updated Evidence: RASTAVI
In patients after successful TAVI with preserved LV function, ramipril was not superior to standard care with respect to cardiac death, HF readmission, and stroke at 1 year.
*Ignacio J Amat-Santos et al. J Am Heart Assoc. 2024 Oct.*

### Statin Therapy
**As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines:**

(A) : Initiate statins for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerosis on the basis of standard risk scores in all patients with calcific AS.

(D) : Do not use statins for the prevention of hemodynamic progression of AS in patients with calcific AS (stages B and C).
