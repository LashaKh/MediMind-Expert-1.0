## Background

### Overview

#### Definition

According to the 2018 ACC/AHA guidelines, elevated BP is defined as systolic pressure of 120-129 mmHg and diastolic pressure < 80 mmHg, stage 1 HTN is defined as SBP of 130-139 mmHg or DBP of 80-89 mmHg, and stage 2 HTN is defined as SBP of ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP of ≥ 90 mmHg. According to the 2024 ESC guidelines, elevated BP is defined as an office SBP of 120-139 mmHg or DBP of 70-89 mmHg, and HTN is defined as an office SBP of ≥ 140 mmHg and DBP of ≥ 90 mmHg.

#### Pathophysiology

Primary HTN etiology is multifactorial and most frequently associated with a combination of environmental (unhealthy diet, increased sodium intake, insufficient potassium intake, inadequate physical activity, overweight/obesity) and genetic factors (multiple risk alleles, gene-gene interactions, fetal programming, epigenetic mechanisms). Secondary HTN etiology includes primary aldosteronism, renal HTN, renal parenchymal disease, pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma, Cushing's syndrome, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypercalcemia and primary hyperparathyroidism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, acromegaly, coarctation of the aorta, and medication or recreational drug use (amphetamines, cocaine, phencyclidine). White-coat HTN and isolated systolic HTN are essential subtypes.

#### Epidemiology

HTN is highly prevalent worldwide. The prevalence of HTN in the US is estimated at 31,900 per 100,000 adults based on the 140/90 mmHg cutoff. Rates are highest in African Americans and increase with age.

#### Risk factors

Risk factors for primary HTN include nonmodifiable factors, such as advancing age, African and Hispanic ancestry, and family history, and modifiable factors, include an unhealthy diet, high sodium intake, low potassium intake, physical inactivity, overweight or obesity, low socioeconomic status, and limited access to healthcare.

#### Disease course

HTN is mostly asymptomatic until an acute hypertensive crisis or end-organ complications occur. Manifestations of end-organ damage in HTN include motor or sensory deficit (brain); hypertensive retinopathy (retina); and AF, arrhythmias, pulmonary congestion and peripheral edema (heart). Secondary HTN presents with symptoms of the causal condition, for example, abdominal bruit in renal artery stenosis or abdominal masses in polycystic kidney disease. A fourth heart sound is often the earliest sign of hypertensive heart disease. HTN decreases health-related QoL.

#### Prognosis and risk of recurrence

Prognosis is highly dependant on the BP and end-organ damage. Higher BP and more severe retinopathy or organ damage are associated with a worse prognosis. Untreated or treatment-resistant HTN leads to lower survival rates. However, effective BP control raises 10-year survival rates to 70%.

## Screening and diagnosis

### Indications for screening, adults:

**As per ESC 2024 guidelines:**
- Obtain office and/or out-of-office BP measurements in all adults (≥ 18 years) on an opportunistic basis, record measurements in their medical file, and inform patients of their current BP. (B)
- Consider obtaining opportunistic screening for elevated BP and HTN at least every 3 years in adults aged < 40 years and at least annually in adults aged ≥ 40 years. (C)
- Consider obtaining a repeat BP measurement and risk assessment within 1 year in patients with elevated BP not currently meeting risk thresholds for BP-lowering treatment. (C)
- Consider using other forms of screening for HTN (systematic screening, self-screening, and non-physician screening) depending on their feasibility in different countries and healthcare systems. (C)

**As per AAFP 2023 guidelines:**
- Obtain screening for HTN with office BP measurements in adults. Confirm the diagnosis with home measurements or with 24-hour ambulatory monitoring before initiating antihypertensive medications. (A)

**As per ESH 2023 guidelines:**
- Obtain screening for HTN (as case finding or opportunistic screening) in all adults. (B)
- Obtain regular BP measurements in adults from the age of 40 years or earlier in patients at high risk. (B)
- Schedule intervals for repeated BP measurements depending on the BP level, the risk of HTN, and cardiovascular risk in individuals without HTN. Obtain annual follow-ups in patients at high risk. (B)

**As per USPSTF 2021 guidelines:**
- Obtain screening for HTN with office BP measurement in ≥ 18 years old adults. Obtain BP measurements outside the clinical setting for diagnostic confirmation before initiating treatment. (A)

**As per AAPA/ABC/ACC/…/PCNA 2018 guidelines:**
- Obtain screening for HTN in adults ≥ 18 years of age. (A)

### Indications for screening, pregnancy:
**As per ESH 2023 guidelines:**
- Consider obtaining home BP monitoring as an alternative to conventional office BP measurement to detect new-onset HTN in patients at risk for preeclampsia without preexisting HTN. (C)

### Indications for screening, children:
**As per ESH 2023 guidelines:**
- Screen BP levels in pediatric patients starting from the age of 3 years. (B)
- Screen BP in pediatric patients aged < 3 years in the presence of risk factors for high BP (such as congenital heart disease, CKD, solid organ transplantation, treatment with BP-increasing drugs, or history of preterm birth). (B)

**As per USPSTF 2020 guidelines:**
- Insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for high BP in children and adolescents. (I)**

## Classification and risk stratification

### Staging:
**As per ESC 2024 guidelines:**
- Classify BP as non-elevated BP, elevated BP, or HTN to aid treatment decisions. (B)

**As per ESH 2023 guidelines:**
Classify BP as follows based on office BP values:

| Situation | Guidance |
|-----------|----------|
| Optimal | < 120 mmHg SBP and < 80 mmHg DBP |
| Normal | 120-129 mmHg SBP and 80-84 mmHg DBP |
| High normal | 130-139 mmHg SBP and/or 85-89 mmHg DBP |
| Grade 1 HTN | 140-159 mmHg SBP and/or 90-99 mmHg DBP |
| Grade 2 HTN | 160-179 mmHg SBP and/or 100-109 mmHg DBP |
| Grade 3 HTN | ≥ 180 mmHg SBP and/or ≥ 110 mmHg DBP |
| Isolated systolic HTN | ≥ 140 mmHg SBP and < 90 mmHg DBP |
| Isolated diastolic HTN | < 140 mmHg SBP and ≥ 90 mmHg DBP |

(B)

Distinguish stage 1, 2, and 3 HTN in addition to grades of HTN based on BP values:

| Situation | Guidance |
|-----------|----------|
| Stage 1 | Uncomplicated HTN without HTN-mediated organ damage, diabetes, CVD, and without CKD ≥ stage 3 |
| Stage 2 | Presence of HTN-mediated organ damage, diabetes, or CKD stage 3 |
| Stage 3 | Presence of CVD or CKD stage 4 or 5 |

(B)

**As per AAPA/ABC/ACC/…/PCNA 2018 guidelines:**
Classify BP as follows to assist in the appropriate prevention and treatment of high BP:

| Situation | Guidance |
|-----------|----------|
| Normal | SBP < 120 mmHg and DBP < 80 mmHg |
| Elevated | SBP 120-129 mmHg and DBP < 80 mmHg |
| Stage 1 HTN | SBP 130-139 mmHg or DBP 80-89 mmHg |
| Stage 2 HTN | SBP ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg |

(B)

### Cardiovascular risk stratification:
**As per ESC 2024 guidelines:**
- Use a risk-based approach in the treatment of elevated BP, recognizing that patients with moderate or severe CKD, established CVD, HTN-mediated organ damage, diabetes mellitus, and familial hypercholesterolemia are at increased risk for CVD events. (B)
- Use the SCORE2 to assess the 10-year risk of fatal and non-fatal CVD in patients aged 40-69 years with elevated BP not already considered at increased risk due to moderate or severe CKD, established CVD, HTN-mediated organ damage, diabetes mellitus, or familial hypercholesterolemia. (B)
- Use the SCORE2-OP to assess the 10-year risk of fatal and non-fatal CVD in patients aged ≥ 70 years with elevated BP not already considered at increased risk due to moderate or severe CKD, established CVD, HTN-mediated organ damage, diabetes mellitus, or familial hypercholesterolemia. (B)
- View patients with elevated BP and a SCORE2 or SCORE2-OP CVD risk of ≥ 10% as at increased risk for CVD, irrespective of age, for the purposes of risk-based management of their elevated BP. (B)
- Consider using the SCORE2-Diabetes to estimate CVD risk in patients with T2DM and elevated BP, particularly if they are < 60 years of age. (C)
- Consider up-classifying patients with elevated BP and borderline increased 10-year CVD risk (5% to < 10% risk) if there is a history of pregnancy complications, such as gestational diabetes, gestational HTN, preterm delivery, preeclampsia, one or more stillbirths, or recurrent miscarriage. (C)
- Consider up-classifying patients with elevated BP and borderline increased 10-year CVD risk (5% to < 10% risk) if they present with high-risk ethnicity (such as South Asian), family history of premature onset ASCVD, socio-economic deprivation, autoimmune inflammatory disorders, HIV, or severe mental illness. (C)
- Consider measuring CAC score, carotid or femoral plaque using ultrasound, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin or BNP biomarkers, or arterial stiffness using pulse wave velocity to improve risk stratification in patients with borderline increased 10-year CVD risk (5% to < 10% risk) after shared decision-making and considering costs if a risk-based BP-lowering treatment decision remains uncertain in patients with elevated BP after assessing 10-year predicted CVD risk and non-traditional CVD risk modifiers. (C)

**As per ESH 2023 guidelines:**
- Obtain cardiovascular risk assessment using the SCORE2 and SCORE2-OP systems in patients with HTN not already at high or very high risk due to established CVD or CKD, long-lasting or complicated diabetes, severe HTN-mediated organ damage (such as LVH), or a markedly elevated single risk factor (such as cholesterol, albuminuria). (B)

**As per HC 2020 guidelines:**
- Assess global cardiovascular risk in patients with HTN. Consider obtaining multifactorial risk assessment models to:
  - predict the patient's global cardiovascular risk more accurately (A)
  - help engage patients in conversations about health behavior change to lower BP (B)
  - use antihypertensive therapy more efficiently (B)
- Avoid using absolute levels of risk to support treatment decisions in the absence of local data to determine the accuracy of risk calculations. (D)
- Consider informing patients of their global risk to improve the effectiveness of risk factor modification. Consider using analogies describing comparative risk, such as "cardiovascular age," "vascular age," or "heart age," to inform patients of their risk status. (C)

## Diagnostic investigations

### Office BP measurement:
**As per HC 2025 guidelines:**
- Obtain BP assessment using a validated automated device and a standardized method. Define HTN in adults as BP ≥ 130/80 mmHg when measured with a validated device under optimal conditions. (B)

**As per ESC 2024 guidelines:**
- Measure office BP in both arms at least at the first visit, as a between-arm SBP difference of >10 mmHg is associated with increased CVD risk and may indicate arterial stenosis. (B)
- Use the arm with the higher BP reading for all subsequent BP measurements if a between-arm difference of >10 mmHg in SBP is recorded. (B)
- Perform pulse palpation at rest to determine HR and arrhythmias such as AF in all patients undergoing BP measurement. (B)
- Consider assessing for orthostatic hypotension (≥ 20 mmHg SBP and/or ≥ 10 mmHg DBP drop at 1 and/or 3 minutes after standing) at least at the initial diagnosis of elevated BP or HTN and thereafter if suggestive symptoms arise. Perform this assessment after the patient has been lying or sitting for 5 minutes. (C)
- Consider obtaining other BP measures and indices (pulse pressure, BP variability, exercise BP) to provide additional clinical information on CVD risk in some circumstances. (C)
- Confirm BP of 160-179/100-109 mmHg as soon as possible (such as within 1 month) preferably by either home or ambulatory BP measurements if screening office BP is ≥ 160/100 mmHg. (B)
- Exclude hypertensive emergency if screening office BP is ≥ 180/110 mmHg. (B)
- Test for orthostatic hypotension, by first having the patient sit or lie for 5 min and then measuring BP 1 and/or 3 min after standing, before starting or intensifying BP-lowering medication. (B)

**As per ESH 2023 guidelines:**
- Obtain office BP measurement for the diagnosis of HTN, as HTN-related risk, benefits of antihypertensive treatment, and treatment-related BP thresholds and goals are based on this method. (A)
- Obtain office BP measurement in standardized conditions using a standard measurement protocol. Obtain triplicate measurements and refer to the average of the last 2 as the representative value. (B)
- Diagnose HTN during at least 2 separate office visits (within 4 weeks) unless office BP indicates grade 3 HTN (≥ 180/110 mmHg) or patients present with HTN-related symptoms or there is evidence of HTN-mediated organ damage or CVD. (B)
- Measure BP in both arms at the first office visit. Suspect atheromatous disease in case of consistent between-arm SBP difference > 15-20 mmHg, which is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Obtain all subsequent measurements on the arm with the highest BP readings. (B)
- Obtain additional information on BP values by ambulatory BP monitoring or home BP monitoring, or both if available, as out-of-office BP is a source of multiple BP-related information before and during treatment. (B)

**As per KDIGO 2021 guidelines:**
- Obtain standardized office BP measurement in preference to routine office BP measurement for the management of high BP in adult patients. (B)

### Out-of-office BP measurement:
**As per HC 2025 guidelines:**
- Obtain out-of-office BP assessment to confirm the diagnosis of HTN or to detect white-coat HTN and masked HTN. (B)

**As per ESC 2024 guidelines:**
- Obtain out-of-office BP measurement for diagnostic purposes, particularly to detect white coat HTN and masked HTN. Confirm the diagnosis with a repeat office BP measurement using the correct standardized measurement technique if out-of-office measurements are not logistically and/or economically feasible. (B)
- Obtain out-of-office BP measurement for ongoing management to quantify the effects of treatment, guide BP-lowering medication titration, and/or identify possible causes of side effects (such as symptomatic hypotension). Initiate ongoing management based on repeated office BP measurements using the correct standardized measurement technique if out-of-office measurements are not logistically and/or economically feasible. (B)
- Measure BP out of the office, using ambulatory BP measurement and/or home BP measurement or, if not logistically feasible, by making repeated office BP measurements on > 1 visit in patients with increased CVD risk if screening office BP is 120-139/70-89 mmHg. (B)
- Establish the diagnosis of HTN based on out-of-office BP measurement with ambulatory BP measurement and/or home BP measurement or, if not logistically or economically feasible, by making repeated office BP measurements on > 1 visit if screening office BP is 140-159/90-99 mmHg. (B)

**As per ESH 2023 guidelines:**

- Treat adults with HTN and PAD similarly to patients with HTN who do not have PAD. (B)

### Patients with AF, evaluation
**As per ESH 2023 guidelines:**
- Obtain evaluation for HTN in patients at risk for AF, such as high-normal BP, LVH, and LA dilatation. Consider using validated (for detecting AF) BP monitoring devices to facilitate the detection of AF. (B)
- Obtain at least three office BP measurements by auscultation in patients with AF to account for the varying BP values. (B)
- Consider using automated oscillatory methods for BP measurement in patients with AF, as these methods satisfactorily measure SBP and only modestly overestimate DBP. (C)

### Patients with AF, antihypertensive therapy:
**As per ESH 2023 guidelines:**
- Initiate antihypertensive therapy to reduce the risk of incident and recurrent AF. Use the same thresholds and targets for BP lowering treatment as for the general population with HTN. (A)
- Consider using all major antihypertensive drug classes to prevent incident or recurrent AF. (B)
- Consider initiating renin-angiotensin system blockers and β-blockers in patients with AF to prevent recurrent AF. (C)
- Treat HTN to reduce the risk of stroke and other cardiovascular outcomes in patients with AF. Use the same BP threshold and targets and drug treatment strategies as for the general population in HTN. (A)

**As per EACTS/ESC 2021 guidelines:**
- Ensure good BP control to reduce AF recurrences and risk of stroke and bleeding in patients with AF and HTN. (B)

**As per AAPA/ABC/ACC/…/PCNA 2018 guidelines:**
- Consider initiating ARBs in patients with AF to prevent recurrence. (C)

### Patients with AF, rate control
**As per ESH 2023 guidelines:**
- Initiate β-blockers for HR control in patients with AF. Lower resting HR to < 110 bpm, targeting an HR of < 80 bpm based on ECG analysis, particularly in symptomatic patients. (B)
- Consider adding digoxin to β-blockers to improve HR control. (C)
- Avoid combining β-blockers with nondihydropyridine CCBs. (D)

### Patients with AF, anticoagulation
**As per ESH 2023 guidelines:**
- Consider initiating OACs for the prevention of stroke in patients with AF and HTN, even when HTN is the single additional risk factor (CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 in males and 2 in females). (C)
- Initiate oral anticoagulation ideally when SBP is < 160 mmHg. Prioritize reducing BP to reduce the risk of major bleeding (including ICH) if SBP is ≥ 160 mmHg. (B)
- Use the same treatment targets and agents in patients with HTN and AF receiving oral anticoagulation as for the general population. (B)
- Be cautious when using nondihydropyridine CCBs (diltiazem or verapamil) for rate control, as they may interfere with OACs and increase bleeding risk. (B)

### Patients with obstructive sleep apnea:
**As per AAPA/ABC/ACC/…/PCNA 2018 guidelines:**
- Insufficient evidence to establish the efficacy of CPAP to reduce BP in adults with HTN and obstructive sleep apnea. (I)**

### Patients with cancer, evaluation

- Obtain echocardiographic evaluation at baseline, during anticancer treatment, and during follow-up in patients treated with cardiotoxic anticancer drugs. (B)
- Obtain BP monitoring after active cancer treatment and during long-term follow-up because BP may drop when anticancer drugs are stopped requiring back-titration or discontinuation of BP-lowering drugs. (B)
- Obtain occasional screenings with BP measurement in cancer survivors and inform them about increased cardiovascular risk, as they have a higher risk of developing HTN and other cardiovascular and renal complications. (A)
- Consider screening for HTN-mediated organ damage (ECG, echocardiography, kidney function parameters, and evidence of HF) and cardiovascular risk before initiating anticancer therapy in patients with HTN and cancer. (C)

### Patients with cancer, management
**As per ESH 2023 guidelines:**

- Do not initiate anticancer therapy in patients with uncontrolled HTN and BP values ≥ 180 mmHg for systolic and/or ≥ 110 mmHg for DBP. (D)
- Initiate measures to control BP and symptoms by team-based multidisciplinary care in patients with uncontrolled HTN and BP values ≥ 180 mmHg for SBP and/or ≥ 110 mmHg for DBP to allow initiation of anticancer therapy as early as possible. (B)
- Consider initiating thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics only if needed for BP control and in patients with fluid retention because of their potential to cause unwanted effects in patients with cancer, including increases in serum calcium concentration in patients with bone metastasis, increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias due to prolonging QT interval (by inducing hypokalemia), increased risk of hyponatremia, and potential worsening of hypovolemic states or dehydration. (C)
- Avoid using nondihydropyridine CCBs in patients with cancer treated with anticancer drugs susceptible to pharmacokinetic interactions mediated by CYP3A4 and/or P-gp. (D)
- Individualize treatment of HTN in severely ill patients with cancer according to symptoms, comorbidities, and polypharmacy in a shared decision-making process. (B)

### Patients with cancer treatment-induced HTN:

**As per EHA/ESC/ESTRO/IC-OS 2022 guidelines:**
- Initiate effective treatment for cancer therapy-induced arterial HTN to prevent cancer treatment interruption and cardiovascular complications. (B)
- Set a BP target of < 140 mmHg systolic and < 90 mmHg diastolic during cancer therapy. (B)
- Consider setting a lower BP target of < 130 mmHg systolic and < 80 mmHg diastolic if the treatment is well tolerated. (B)
- Consider setting an SBP 140-160 mmHg and DBP 90-100 mmHg treatment threshold in selected asymptomatic patients with metastatic cancer, provided there is ongoing BP monitoring. (C)
- Obtain cardiovascular risk evaluation if the SBP is ≥ 180 mmHg or DBP ≥ 110 mmHg. Defer or temporarily withhold any cancer therapy associated with HTN until the BP is controlled to values < 160 mmHg (systolic) and < 100 mmHg (diastolic). (B)
- Initiate ACEis or ARBs as first-line antihypertensive drugs for BP management in patients with cancer. (B)
- Initiate dihydropyridine CCBs as second-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with uncontrolled BP. (B)
- Initiate combination therapy with ACEis/ARBs and dihydropyridine CCBs in patients with SBP ≥ 160 mmHg and DBP ≥ 100 mmHg. (B)
- Do not use diltiazem and verapamil for treatment of HTN in patients receiving cancer treatment with agents susceptible to CYP3A4-mediated drug interactions. (D)
- Optimize cardiovascular follow-up and treatment in patients with TKIs-mediated HTN during cancer therapy. (B)

**As per CCS 2016 guidelines:**
- Initiate, maintain, or augment antihypertensive therapy in patients with preexisting HTN or patients developing HTN related to cancer therapy. (A)
- Set a target BP of < 140/90 mmHg in all patients without diabetes. Adjust the BP target to < 130/80 mmHg in patients with diabetes. (A)

### Patients with stimulant intoxication:
**As per AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines:**
- Administer short-acting agents, such as sodium nitroprusside, phentolamine, or dihydropyridine CCBs, in patients with stimulant intoxication experiencing a hypertensive emergency. Avoid using long-acting antihypertensives to avoid abrupt hemodynamic collapse. Administer nitroglycerin if signs or symptoms of cardiac ischemia are present. (B)

### Patients with glaucoma
**As per ESH 2023 guidelines:**
- Consider obtaining screening for glaucoma in > 60 years old (or > 40 years old in African Americans) patients with HTN. (C)
- Obtain ambulatory BP monitoring and closer ophthalmologic examinations in association with frequent BP measurements (including ambulatory BP monitoring) in patients with HTN and glaucoma, particularly in patients with unexplained visual field deterioration. (B)
- Attempt avoiding both very low and very high BP in patients with glaucoma, particularly during the night. (B)
- Avoid administering bedtime antihypertensive drugs in patients with glaucoma, as it may increase the risk of excessive BP lowering and visual field loss. (D)
- Consider preferring β-blockers in patients with HTN and glaucoma, as they have been associated with lower intraocular pressure and decreased risk of primary open-angle glaucoma. (C)

## Preventative measures

### Body weight control:
**As per ESC 2024 guidelines:**
- Counsel patients to aim for a stable and healthy BMI (20-25 kg/m²) and waist circumference values (< 94 cm for males and < 80 cm for females) to reduce BP and CVD risk. (A)

**As per HC 2020 guidelines:**
- Advise maintaining a healthy body weight (BMI 18.5-24.9) and waist circumference (< 102 cm for males and < 88 cm for females) to prevent HTN in individuals not having HTN. (B)
- Offer a multidisciplinary approach for weight loss, including dietary education, increased physical activity, and behavioral intervention. (B)

### Antiplatelet therapy:
**As per CAIC/CCS 2024 guidelines:**
- Do not initiate aspirin routinely for primary prevention of ASCVD in patients without ASCVD, regardless of sex, age, or diabetes status. (D)

**As per ESH 2023 guidelines:**
- Do not initiate low-dose aspirin for primary prevention in patients with HTN. (D)

**As per USPSTF 2022 guidelines:**
- Individualize the decision to initiate low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of CVDs in adults aged 40-59 years with a ≥ 10% 10-year CVD risk, particularly in individuals not at increased risk for bleeding and willing to take low-dose aspirin daily. (B)
- Do not initiate low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of CVDs in adults aged ≥ 60 years. (D)

### Statin therapy
**As per USPSTF 2022 guidelines:**
- Initiate statin therapy for primary prevention of CVDs in adults aged 40-75 years with ≥ 1 CVD risk factors (dyslipidemia, diabetes, HTN, or smoking) and an estimated 10-year CVD risk ≥ 10%. (B)
- Consider initiating statin therapy for primary prevention of CVDs in selected adults aged 40-75 years with ≥ 1 CVD risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7.5-10%. (C)
- Insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults aged ≥ 76 years. (I)**

## Follow-up and surveillance

**As per ESH 2023 guidelines:**
- Obtain a follow-up to assess BP control, the need for lifestyle and drug treatment changes, to identify HTN-mediated organ damage and necessary risk factor modifications, and to check adherence in patients with HTN. (B)
- Arrange physician visits (including virtual care visits) every month or even more frequently during the first 3 months after treatment initiation, depending on HTN grade, cardiovascular risk, previous unsuccessful attempts to achieve blood control, and other factors suggesting antihypertensive treatment difficulties, provided lifestyle interventions and drug treatment strategies to achieve BP control are implemented. (B)
- Consider arranging less frequent visits after the end of the titration phase, provided BP is controlled. Consider arranging annual visits to favor the physician-patient relationship and adherence. Consider arranging more frequent visits if BP control was more difficult during the titration phase and in patients at high cardiovascular risk. (B)
- Obtain standard measurements of office BP, update medical history (side effects of treatment in particular), and perform physical examinations during follow-up visits. Obtain laboratory tests on a frequency depending on the clinical condition and risk level of the patient. Consider obtaining an ECG and blood tests at annual intervals in low-risk patients. Check adherence at each visit. (B)
- Consider obtaining ambulatory BP monitoring during the follow-up evaluations whenever possible. Consider obtaining it at yearly intervals but decide on the frequency depending on the HTN grade, BP variability between visits, and the BP phenotypes in previous ambulatory BP monitoring recordings. (C)
- Obtain home BP monitoring ideally by using automatic electronic devices allowing automated storage and asynchronous data transfer to care providers with mobile phones, personal computers, internet links, or cloud-based connectivity. Use home BP monitoring data for prompting physician visits where changes in treatment and overall management should be decided. (B)
- Obtain periodic assessments for HTN-mediated organ damage. Consider obtaining subsequent assessments at longer intervals, such as every 3 years, in patients without preexisting HTN-mediated organ damage. Obtain assessments more frequently depending on the type of HTN-mediated organ damage, sensitivity to change detection, or HTN-mediated organ damage-related symptoms in patients with preexisting HTN-mediated organ damage. (B)

**As per AAPA/ABC/ACC/…/PCNA 2018 guidelines:**
- Obtain a follow-up evaluation of treatment response at monthly intervals until control is achieved in adult patients initiating a new or adjusted drug regimen for HTN. (B)
- Include systematic strategies to help improve BP, including home BP monitoring, team-based care, and telehealth strategies, in the follow-up and monitoring after initiating pharmacotherapy for HTN control. (A)

### Assessment of treatment adherence:
**As per ESC 2024 guidelines:**
- Consider obtaining an objective evaluation of adherence, either through directly observing treatment or detecting prescribed drugs in blood or urine samples, in the clinical work-up of patients with apparent resistant HTN, if resources allow. (C)

### Updated evidence: ADH-Wizard
In adult patients undergoing treatment for hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, clinical decision support was not superior to usual care with respect to adherence to glucose control medications at 12 months.
Patrick J O'Connor et al. JAMA Netw Open. 2025 Jan 2.
