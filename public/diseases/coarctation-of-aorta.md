# Coarctation of Aorta


**Updated May 31, 2025**

## Background

### Overview

#### **Definition**
Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is a congenital heart defect characterized by a discrete narrowing of the thoracic aorta, typically distal to the left subclavian artery.

#### **Pathophysiology**
The pathogenesis of coarctation is not fully understood, but two main theories exist. The hemodynamic hypothesis suggests that reduced in utero blood flow across the aortic isthmus leads to abnormal aortic development. The ectopic ductal tissue hypothesis proposes that ductal tissue extends into the aorta, thickening its walls, and as the ductus arteriosus closes, this creates the coarctation. Coarctation of the aorta results in elevated afterload on the left ventricle, leading to LVH and hypertension, and may induce the development of collateral circulation.

#### Epidemiology
CoA is the sixth most common congenital heart disease, occurring in up to 1 in 3,000 to 4,000 live births.

#### **Risk factors**
Risk factors for coarctation of the aorta include genetic conditions such as Turner's syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve, elongation of the transverse aorta, and hypertension.

#### **Disease course**
Clinically, CoA is often asymptomatic, but can present with severe hypertension leading to headache, epistaxis, HF and/or aortic dissection. Other symptoms may include exertional intolerance, dizziness, lower extremity claudication, abdominal angina and ICH. CoA can be complicated by the development of aortic aneurysms, particularly in the ascending aorta.

#### **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**
The prognosis of CoA largely depends on the timing of diagnosis and intervention. Early detection and intervention, such as open or endovascular repair, can lead to good outcomes, including better BP control. The 15-year survival rate after CoA repair in patients aged < 21 years is reported to be 92%.

## Surgical interventions

### Indications for procedural intervention

As per ESC 2024 guidelines:
- Perform coarctation or re-coarctation repair (either surgical or endovascular), with a preference for stenting when technically feasible, in patients with hypertension with an increased noninvasive gradient between the upper and lower limbs (decreased ankle-brachial index) confirmed with invasive measurement (peak-to-peak > 20 mmHg). (B)
- Consider performing endovascular treatment in patients with hypertension with > 50% narrowing relative to the aortic diameter at the diaphragm, even if the invasive peak-to-peak gradient is < 20 mmHg, when technically feasible. (C)
- Consider performing endovascular treatment in normotensive patients with an increased noninvasive gradient confirmed with invasive peak-to-peak gradient > 20 mmHg, when technically feasible. (C)

As per EACTS/STS 2024 guidelines:
- Treat clinically significant CoA, either primary or recurrent. (B)
- Consider treating patients with documented hypertension with > 50% aortic luminal narrowing in relation to the aortic diameter at the level of the diaphragm (based on MRI, CT, or invasive angiography measurements), regardless of the pressure gradient. (C)
- Consider performing open or endovascular repair in asymptomatic patients with CoA with a systolic gradient across the stenosis at rest (> 20 mmHg) and/or SBP difference > 10 mmHg combined with coarctation-attributed HF and/or proximal hypertension. (C)
- Consider performing endovascular repair as an alternative to open surgical repair in patients with coarctation of the native thoracic aorta as well as after previous repair and suitable anatomy. (C)
- Consider performing extra-anatomical bypass from the ascending to the descending aorta at the time of concomitant cardiac repair in patients requiring coarctation re-repair. (C)

As per ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines, perform endovascular stenting or open surgical repair in patients with significant native or recurrent CoA and hypertension. (B)

As per ESC 2021 guidelines:

## Specific circumstances

### Patients with Turner's syndrome

As per ESE/PES 2024 guidelines:
- Ensure informed, individualized decision-making about the timing of elective aortic surgery in adult patients with Turner syndrome, taking into account risk factors for aortic dissection, including moderate aortic dilation (aortic height index > 23 mm/m, aortic size index > 2.3 cm/m², or Z > 3.5) with at least one additional risk factor: bicuspid aortic valve, CoA, hypertension, or a rapid increase in aortic diameter (> 3 mm/year). Recognize that dissection risk probably increases if more than one additional risk factor is present. Evaluate for elective aortic surgery in case of severe aortic dilation (aortic height index > 25 mm/m, aortic size index > 2.5 cm/m², or Z > 4) as a single risk factor. (B)
- Recognize that the risk of aortic dissection is much lower in pediatric patients than in adult patients. Ensure informed, individualized decision-making about the timing of elective aortic surgery, taking into account risk factors for aortic dissection, including moderate aortic dilation (age < 15 years: Z > 3.5; age ≥ 15 years: aortic height index ≥ 23 mm/m, aortic size index > 2.3 cm/m², or Z > 3.5) and hypertension, CoA, bicuspid aortic valve, or a rapid increase in aortic diameter (> 3 mm/year or > 1 Z/year). (B)
- Obtain regular aortic imaging and cardiovascular follow-up with consideration for intervention before pregnancy in patients with CoA becoming pregnant. (B)
- Advise avoiding assisted reproductive technologies or spontaneous conception in the presence of severe aortic dilation (aortic height index > 25 mm/m, aortic size index > 2.5 cm/m², or Z > 4) and especially when other risk factors for aortic dissection are present (previous aortic surgery, previous aortic dissection, or rapid aortic diameter increase (> 3 mm/year), bicuspid aortic valve, hypertension, or CoA). (B)
- Consider obtaining a TTE at least once every 12 weeks during pregnancy, or more frequently on an individualized basis, in the presence of aortic dilation (aortic height index > 20 mm/m, aortic size index > 2.0 cm/m², or Z > 2.5) or at least one other risk factor (bicuspid aortic valve, aortic coarctation, hypertension, rapid aortic diameter increase). Consider obtaining additional imaging in the early third trimester if there is any concerning change observed on the second trimester TTE. (C)
- Decide on the mode of delivery based on the safest method to prevent aortic and obstetric complications, individual preferences, and local professional expertise. Consider implementing preventive measures (epidural anesthesia, expedited second stage of labor) to reduce the risk of aortic dissection, especially in the presence of aortic dilation (aortic height index > 20 mm/m, aortic size index > 2.0 cm/m², or Z > 2.5) or additional risk factors for aortic dissection (bicuspid aortic valve, aortic coarctation, hypertension, rapid aortic diameter increase). Prefer Cesarean delivery in patients with severe aortic dilation (aortic height index > 25 mm/m, aortic size index > 2.5 cm/m², or Z > 4) or a history of aortic dissection. (B)
- Provide informed, individualized peripartum cardiovascular care by a multidisciplinary team including a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and a cardiologist with expertise in managing patients with Turner syndrome, preferably in a center with expertise in aortic surgery and Turner syndrome, in the presence of aortic dilation (aortic height index > 20 mm/m, aortic size index > 2.0 cm/m², or Z > 2.5) or at least one other risk factor for dissection (bicuspid aortic valve, aortic coarctation, hypertension, rapid aortic diameter increase). (B)

As per AATS/ACC/ACR/…/SVM 2010 guidelines:
- Obtain imaging of the heart and aorta for evidence of bicuspid aortic valve, CoA, or dilatation of the ascending thoracic aorta in patients with Turner syndrome. (B)
- Consider obtaining imaging of the heart and aorta to help determine the risk of aortic dissection in patients with Turner syndrome with additional risk factors, including bicuspid aortic valve, CoA, and/or hypertension, and in pregnant patients (or attempting pregnancy). (C)

## Follow-up and surveillance

### Follow-up
As per ESC 2024 guidelines, obtain lifelong follow-up including regular imaging of the aorta with cardiovascular CT/cardiovascular MRI every 3-5 years (adapted to clinical status and previous imaging findings) in patients with native or repaired CoA. (B)
