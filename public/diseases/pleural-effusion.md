**Updated:** May 31, 2025


## Background

### Overview

#### **Definition**
Pleural effusion is a disease characterized by pathologic accumulation of fluid in the pleural space. 

#### **Pathophysiology**
Common causes of pleural effusions include congestive HF, pneumonia, malignancy, and PE. 

#### **Epidemiology**
The incidence of pleural effusion in the US is estimated at 400 cases per 100,000 person-years. 

#### **Disease course**
Accumulation of fluid in the pleural space with resultant pleural irritation and compression atelectasis results in clinical manifestations of dyspnea, pleuritic pain, and dry cough. 

#### **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**
In hospitalized patients, pleural effusion is associated with 30-day and 1-year mortality of 15% and 32%, respectively.

## Diagnostic investigations

### General principles
As per BTS 2023 guidelines, Interpret imaging findings of a unilateral pleural effusion in the context of clinical history and knowledge of pleural fluid characteristics. (E)

### Chest ultrasound
As per AAFP 2023 guidelines, Obtain a point-of-care chest ultrasound, if available, along with a CXR in the initial evaluation of the pleural space to determine the size and character of the effusion. (B)
As per EFSUMB 2022 guidelines, Consider Obtaining a point-of-care chest ultrasound for the diagnosis of pleural effusion, as it has better diagnostic accuracy than CXR and clinical examination. (B)
As per SCCM 2015 guidelines, Obtain a chest ultrasound to complement physical examination and conventional CXR for the diagnosis and localization of pleural effusion. (A)

### Chest CT/PET
As per AAFP 2023 guidelines, Obtain CT in patients with suspected malignancy, recognizing that a negative CT result does not exclude malignancy. (B)
As per EFSUMB 2022 guidelines, Do not Obtain PET-CT for the evaluation of pleural infection. (D)

### Serum biomarkers
As per BTS 2023 guidelines:
- Consider Obtaining serum NT-proBNP to support the diagnosis of HF in patients with unilateral pleural effusion suspected of having HF. (C)
- Do not Obtain serum biomarkers for the diagnosis of secondary pleural malignancy, pleural infection, or autoimmune pleuritis. (D)
- Do not Obtain serum biomarkers routinely for the diagnosis of tuberculous pleural effusion, but Consider Obtaining them in high-prevalence areas. (D)
- Do not use serum biomarkers, including NT-proBNP, in isolation for the diagnosis of unilateral pleural effusion, as multiple conditions may coexist. (D)

## Diagnostic procedures

### Diagnostic thoracentesis
As per AAFP 2023 guidelines:
- Perform diagnostic thoracentesis for new-onset, unilateral, and larger than minimal pleural effusions in the absence of clinically evident HF, cirrhosis, or kidney failure appropriately responsive to therapy. Perform therapeutic thoracentesis to relieve symptoms. (B)
- Use ultrasound guidance for thoracentesis to decrease the risk of pneumothorax and solid organ puncture. (B)
- Do not Obtain routine CXR after pleural aspiration unless the patient is symptomatic, air is aspirated, or after multiple thoracentesis attempts. (D)

As per BTS 2023 guidelines, use image guidance for thoracentesis to reduce the risk of complications. (A)

As per SCCM 2015 guidelines, use ultrasound guidance to assist in drainage (including needle guidance), particularly of small or loculated effusions. (B)

### Pleural fluid culture
As per BTS 2023 guidelines:
- Send pleural fluid in both plain and blood culture bottle tubes in patients with suspected pleural infection. (A)
- Send microbiological samples in both white top containers and volumes of 5-10 mL inoculated into (aerobic and anaerobic) blood culture bottles in patients with an undiagnosed pleural effusion and suspected pleural infection, provided the volume of fluid sample available allows. Prioritize volumes of 2-5 mL to blood culture bottles rather than a plain, sterile container in cases where the volume available does not allow 5-10 mL inoculation. (E)

### Pleural fluid cytology
As per BTS 2023 guidelines:
- Obtain pleural fluid cytology as an initial diagnostic test in patients with suspected secondary pleural malignancy. Consider Obtaining further investigation in case of negative cytology. (B)
- Submit 25-50 mL of pleural fluid for cytological analysis in patients with suspected malignant pleural effusion. (A)
- Send at least 25 mL (50 mL where possible) of pleural fluid for initial cytological examination. Send smaller volumes if volumes of ≥ 25 mL cannot be achieved, acknowledging the reduced sensitivity. (E)
- Send a larger volume, if achievable, when a small volume aspirate (< 25 mL) has been nondiagnostic, except when there is a high suspicion of a tumor type associated with low pleural fluid cytology sensitivity (especially mesothelioma). (E)
- Process pleural fluid samples by direct smear and cell block preparation. (E)
- Take into account that the clinical utility of pleural fluid cytology varies by tumor subtype, including diagnostic sensitivity and predictive value for response to subsequent cancer therapies when planning the most suitable diagnostic strategy (for example, direct biopsies in cases with a likely low cytological yield). (E)

### Pleural fluid biomarkers
As per BTS 2023 guidelines:
- Do not Obtain pleural fluid biomarkers for the diagnosis of secondary pleural malignancy. (D)
- Consider Obtaining pleural fluid adenosine deaminase and/or IFN-γ testing for the diagnosis of tuberculous pleural effusion in high-prevalent populations. (C)
- Consider Obtaining pleural fluid adenosine deaminase testing as an exclusion test for tuberculous pleural effusion in low-prevalent populations. (C)
- Consider Obtaining pleural fluid antinuclear antibody to support a diagnosis of lupus pleuritis. (C)
- Consider Obtaining pleural fluid NT-proBNP for the evaluation of HF as a cause of unilateral pleural effusion. Avoid Obtaining it routinely as it is not superior to serum NT-proBNP. (E)

### Pleural biopsy
As per BTS 2023 guidelines:
- Consider performing thoracoscopic or image-guided pleural biopsy depending on the clinical indication and local availability of techniques (including the need for control of pleural fluid). Do not perform blind (non-image-guided) pleural biopsies. (B)
- Obtain tissue sampling for culture and sensitivity in all patients with suspected tuberculous pleural effusion. (A)

## Respiratory support

### Supplemental oxygen
As per BTS 2017 guidelines, Target an oxygen saturation of 94-98% in patients with pleural effusions, or 88-92% if the patient is at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure. (B)

## Specific circumstances

### Patients with malignant pleural effusion, diagnostic imaging
As per BTS 2023 guidelines, Consider Obtaining an ultrasound at presentation to support the diagnosis of pleural malignancy, particularly in the context of a pleural effusion, where appropriate sonographic skills are present. (C)
As per ATS/STR/STS 2018 guidelines, Consider Obtaining an ultrasound to guide pleural interventions in patients with known or suspected malignant pleural effusion. (C)

### Patients with malignant pleural effusion, general principles of management
As per BTS 2023 guidelines:
- Decide on treatment modality for malignant pleural effusion and non-expanded lung based on patient choice. Discuss the relative risks and benefits of each modality with the patient and inform them of the limited evidence base regarding treatment options for a non-expandable lung. (E)
- Consider using a validated risk score for malignant pleural effusion if the information is of use in planning treatments or in discussion with patients. (E)
- Manage patients with pleural malignancy with a multidisciplinary approach, including referral to specialist palliative care services where appropriate. (E)

As per ATS/STR/STS 2018 guidelines, Do not perform therapeutic pleural interventions in asymptomatic patients with known or suspected malignant pleural effusion. (D)

### Patients with malignant pleural effusion, thoracentesis
As per BTS 2023 guidelines, Discuss alternative options with the patient, as pleural aspiration may result in a need for multiple procedures. (E)

As per ATS/STR/STS 2018 guidelines, Consider performing large-volume thoracentesis in patients with symptomatic malignant pleural effusion if it is uncertain whether the patient's symptoms are related to the effusion and/or if the lung is expandable (the latter if pleurodesis is contemplated) to assess lung expansion. (C)

### Patients with malignant pleural effusion, indwelling pleural catheter
As per BTS 2023 guidelines:
- Perform indwelling pleural catheter placement or pleurodesis as the first-line intervention for the management of malignant pleural effusion in patients without known non-expandable lung. Discuss the relative risks and benefits with patients to individualize treatment choices. (B)
- Consider performing indwelling pleural catheter placement to control symptoms in patients with a non-expandable lung. Consider performing pleural aspiration first to assess symptomatic response. (E)
- Consider performing indwelling pleural catheter placement rather than talc pleurodesis in patients with radiologically significant (> 25%) non-expandable lung requiring intervention for symptomatic malignant pleural effusion. (E)
- Refer patients with an inserted indwelling pleural catheter to the community nursing team on discharge for an early assessment of the wound site, symptom control, support with indwelling pleural catheter drainage, and removal of sutures. (E)
- Refer patients back to the primary pleural team for further assessment in case of complications, such as infection refractory to community management, suspected drain fracture, loculations, or blockage with persistent breathlessness. (E)
- Perform daily indwelling pleural catheter drainage if indwelling pleural catheter removal is a priority to offer increased rates of pleurodesis compared with less frequent drainages of symptom-guided or alternate drainage regimes. (B)
- Counsel patients that they do not require daily drainage to control symptoms of breathlessness and chest pain if they desire a less intensive regime. (A)
- Decide on the optimal drainage frequency based on patient choice. (E)
- Explain to patients of the effect of drainage regimes on patient-center outcomes, such as breathlessness, and the possibility of autopleurodesis during the disease course. (E)
- Recognize that although daily drainage may result in earlier removal of indwelling pleural catheter, there may be an associated cost associated with the increased number of drainage events (both to the healthcare system and to the patient). (E)

As per ATS/STR/STS 2018 guidelines:
- Consider performing either indwelling pleural catheter placement or chemical pleurodesis as the first-line definitive intervention for the management of dyspnea in patients with malignant pleural effusion with known (or likely) suspected expandable lung and no prior definitive therapy if the patient's symptoms are attributable to the effusion. (C)
- Consider performing indwelling pleural catheter placement over chemical pleurodesis in patients with symptomatic malignant pleural effusion with non-expandable lung, failed pleurodesis, or loculated effusion. (C)
- Attempt treating indwelling pleural catheter-associated infections without catheter removal. Consider removing the catheter if the infection fails to improve. (B)

### Patients with malignant pleural effusion, pleurodesis
As per BTS 2023 guidelines:
- Perform talc pleurodesis (or another method) in preference to repeated aspiration for the management of malignant pleural effusion, especially in patients with a better prognosis, but discuss the relative risks and benefits with the patient. (B)
- Consider performing talc slurry or talc poudrage to control fluid and reduce the need for repeated procedures in patients with malignant pleural effusion. (C)
- Perform pleurodesis or indwelling pleural catheter placement as the first-line intervention for the management of malignant pleural effusion in patients without known non-expandable lung. Discuss the relative risks and benefits with patients to individualize treatment choices. (B)
- Consider performing talc slurry pleurodesis to improve QoL, chest pain, breathlessness, and pleurodesis rates in patients with malignant pleural effusion and < 25% non-expandable lung. (E)
- Administer talc via an indwelling pleural catheter in patients with an expandable lung where the clinician or patient deems achieving pleurodesis and indwelling pleural catheter removal to be important. (B)
- Consider performing either surgical talc pleurodesis or medical talc slurry for the management of malignant pleural effusion in selected patients deemed fit enough for surgery. Discuss the relative risks, benefits, and availability of both techniques with patients to individualize treatment choices. (C)
- Perform talc pleurodesis via poudrage during the same procedure if a diagnostic procedure is being performed at thoracoscopy (pleural biopsies). (E)

As per ATS/STR/STS 2018 guidelines, Consider using either talc poudrage or talc slurry for talc pleurodesis in patients with symptomatic malignant pleural effusion and expandable lung. (C)

### Patients with malignant pleural effusion, intrapleural fibrinolytics
As per BTS 2023 guidelines:
- Consider administering intrapleural fibrinolytics to improve breathlessness in highly selected symptomatic patients with malignant pleural effusion and septated effusion. (E)
- Consider administering intrapleural fibrinolytics in patients with malignant pleural effusion and septated effusion and an indwelling pleural catheter to improve drainage if flushing the indwelling pleural catheter with normal saline or heparin saline does not improve drainage. (E)

### Patients with malignant pleural effusion, intrapleural chemotherapy
As per BTS 2023 guidelines, Do not use routine intrapleural chemotherapy in patients with malignant pleural effusion. (D)

Offer systemic anticancer therapy as the standard of care in all patients with metastatic malignancy and good performance status. (D)

### Patients with malignant pleural effusion, surgery
As per BTS 2023 guidelines:
- Consider performing decortication surgery to improve pleurodesis success in patients with malignant pleural effusion with a non-expandable lung. Discuss the risks and benefits of indwelling pleural catheter and surgical treatment with the patient and individualize treatment according to circumstances (such as fitness to undergo thoracic surgery). (E)
- Consider performing surgery for palliation of symptoms in a minority of patients with significantly septated malignant pleural effusion and associated symptoms and otherwise good prognosis and performance status. (E)

## Follow-up and surveillance

### Follow-up
As per BTS 2023 guidelines:
- Consider Obtaining follow-up CT to exclude occult malignancy in patients presenting with pleural infection and having ongoing symptoms or other clinically concerning features. (E)
- Consider Obtaining follow-up CT to exclude occult malignancy in patients presenting with pleural thickening and unexplained unilateral pleural effusion unless a clear diagnosis is reached by other means (such as biopsy). (E)
