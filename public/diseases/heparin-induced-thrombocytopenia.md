### Indications for Testing, Low Pretest Probability

As per GIHP 2020 guidelines, do not Obtain specific laboratory evaluation for the exclusion of HIT in patients with low (4T ≤ 3) pretest probability. Obtain close monitoring of platelet count to search for an etiology of thrombocytopenia. (D)

As per ASH 2018 guidelines, do not Obtain laboratory testing in patients with low pretest probability based on the 4Ts score. (D)

As per BCSH 2012 guidelines, do not Obtain laboratory evaluation for the exclusion of HIT in patients with low pretest probability. (D)

(E)

As per ACCP 2012 guidelines, Consider Obtaining platelet count measurement in patients presenting with acute systemic reactions within 30 minutes of an IV heparin bolus. (E)

As per BCSH 2012 guidelines, suspect and assess for HIT in patients with new thrombosis, skin allergy, or any other rarer manifestations of HIT developing between day 4 and day 14 of heparin administration. (B)

As per BCSH 2012 guidelines, suspect HIT if the platelet count falls by ≥ 30% between days 4 and 14 of heparin administration. (B)

## Classification and Risk Stratification

### Pretest Probability

As per GIHP 2020 guidelines:
- Use the 4T score (outside a cardiac surgery context) to determine the clinical probability of HIT in patients with suspected HIT. (E)
- Consider classifying the risk of HIT during heparin administration into three groups:

| Situation | Risk Level | Guidance |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Low (< 0.1%) | Treatment with LMWH in medicine (except cancer), obstetrics (except surgery including C-section), or in the course of minor trauma; Treatment with fondaparinux; Isolated UFH injection for an endovascular procedure or simple surgery; Treatment with UFH or LMWH lasting > 1 month | |
| Intermediate (0.1-1%) | Prophylactic treatment with UFH in medicine/obstetrics; Prophylactic treatment with LMWH in patients with cancer or severe trauma or in postoperative care (including cardiac surgery) | |
| High (> 1%) | Prophylactic treatment with UFH in surgery (including circulatory assistance) or for RRT; All curative treatments with UFH in medicine/surgery/obstetrics | |

(E)

As per ASH 2018 guidelines, use the 4Ts score rather than a gestalt approach to estimate the probability of HIT in patients with suspected HIT. (B)

### 4Ts Score for Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia

*Calculator Available*

The 4Ts score for Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a clinical scoring system used to estimate the pretest probability of HIT, a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur in patients receiving heparin therapy.

### Classification

As per GIHP 2020 guidelines, Consider classifying HIT into three stages:

| Stage | Timeframe | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Acute HIT** | Diagnosed within the last month | Anti-PF4 antibodies most often present with a high thrombotic risk |
| **Subacute HIT** | Diagnosed 1-3 months ago | Anti-PF4 antibodies often present with a low titer |
| **Previous history of HIT** | Diagnosed > 3 months ago | Anti-PF4 antibodies most often are undetectable |

(E)

## Diagnostic Investigations

### Immunoassays

As per GIHP 2020 guidelines:
- Consider Obtaining anti-PF4 antibodies as soon as possible in patients with suspected HIT with intermediate or high clinical probability. (E)
- Obtain biological tests to detect anti-PF4 antibodies in patients with intermediate (4T = 4-5) or high (4T ≥ 6) pretest probability. (E)

As per ASH 2018 guidelines, Obtain an immunoassay in patients with suspected HIT with an intermediate or high pretest probability based on the 4Ts score. (B)

As per BCSH 2012 guidelines:
- Obtain an antigen assay of high sensitivity in non-expert laboratories. Measure only the IgG class. Report actual optical density, degree of inhibition by high dose heparin, and the cut-off point for a positive test rather than simply the test as positive or negative. (B)
- Do not Obtain platelet aggregation assays using platelet-rich plasma because of lack of sensitivity. (D)

### Platelet Function Tests

As per GIHP 2020 guidelines, Obtain a platelet function test to confirm the diagnosis of HIT in patients with intermediate or high clinical probability and a significant titer of anti-PF4 antibodies. (E)

As per ASH 2018 guidelines, Consider Obtaining a functional assay, if available, either locally or as a send-out test to a reference laboratory, in patients with suspected HIT with positive immunoassay results. (C)

As per BCSH 2012 guidelines, Recognize that platelet activation assays using washed platelets (heparin-induced platelet activation assay and serotonin release assay) have a higher sensitivity than platelet aggregation assays using platelet-rich plasma and are regarded as the reference standard, but are technically demanding. Restrict their use to experienced laboratories. (B)

### Screening for Asymptomatic DVT

As per ASH 2018 guidelines:
- Consider Obtaining bilateral lower-extremity compression ultrasound to screen for asymptomatic proximal DVT in patients with acute isolated HIT. (C)
- Consider Obtaining upper-extremity ultrasound in the limb with the catheter to screen for asymptomatic DVT in patients with acute isolated HIT and an upper-extremity central venous catheter. Avoid Obtaining upper-extremity ultrasound in limbs without central venous catheters. (C)

## Medical Management

### Continuation of Heparin

As per GIHP 2020 guidelines, Consider continuing or resuming heparin therapy, with close monitoring of platelet count, after the exclusion of HIT based on the absence of anti-PF4 antibodies in patients with intermediate clinical probability. (E)

As per ASH 2018 guidelines, Do not discontinue heparin empirically in patients with suspected HIT with a low probability score. (D)

### Discontinuation of Heparin

As per GIHP 2020 guidelines, Discontinue heparin immediately (without waiting for the results of biological tests) and Initiate a non-heparin anticoagulant at curative doses in patients with a high (4T ≥ 6, or extracorporeal circulation with biphasic platelet count progression profile) clinical probability of HIT. (E)
