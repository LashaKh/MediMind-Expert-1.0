## Screening and Diagnosis

### Definition
As per ERS 2021 guidelines, consider viewing patients with symptoms attributable to post-thrombotic deposits within pulmonary arteries as having CTEPD, with or without pulmonary hypertension. Use CTEPH term in patients with pulmonary hypertension. (E)

### Epidemiology
As per ERS 2021 guidelines:

- Recognize that CTEPH is a rare and underdiagnosed complication of PE and upon first presentation may be misclassified as acute PE. (E)
- Recognize that persistent perfusion defects after acute PE are common, but have highly variable clinical relevance, ranging from completely asymptomatic to established CTEPH. (E)
- Insufficient evidence to suggest that CTEPD without pulmonary hypertension is an early stage of CTEPH, because of a lack of data on its natural history. (I)
- Insufficient evidence to demonstrate any difference in CTEPH incidence in patients with VTE treated with VKAs and non-VKA OACs. (I)

### Pathophysiology
As per ERS 2021 guidelines:

- Recognize that two types of vascular lesions exist in CTEPH:
  - Proximal fibrotic obstruction in large elastic pulmonary arteries
  - Secondary microvasculopathy in pulmonary vessels < 500 mcm (E)
- Recognize that morphological delineation of pulmonary and bronchial circulation is possible with CTPA, while MRI permits both anatomical visualization and semi-quantitative analysis of the extent of bronchopulmonary shunting, and none of these techniques can quantify the microvasculopathy. (E)
- Recognize that the right ventricle is less adapted in CTEPH than in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, but recovers largely after successful pulmonary endarterectomy. (E)

### Indications for Screening
As per ERS 2021 guidelines, insufficient evidence to recommend screening for CTEPH in asymptomatic patients with specific risk factors. (I)
As per ERS/ESC 2016 guidelines, do not screen asymptomatic survivors of PE for CTEPH. (D)
As per CTS 2010 guidelines, avoid obtaining routine echocardiography or follow-up imaging (V/Q, CT or MRI) to screen for CTEPH in asymptomatic patients following an acute VTE. (D)

### Indications for Testing
As per ERS/ESC 2022 guidelines:

- Obtain diagnostic evaluation to assess for CTEPH/CTEPD in patients with persistent or new-onset dyspnea or exercise intolerance after PE. (B)
- Refer symptomatic patients with mismatched perfusion lung defects beyond 3 months of anticoagulation or acute PE to a pulmonary hypertension/CTEPH center, after considering the results of echocardiography, BNP/NT-proBNP, and/or cardiopulmonary exercise testing. (B)

As per ERS 2021 guidelines:

- Evaluate patients with acute PE with risk factors or radiological findings of CTEPH for early diagnosis of CTEPH. (E)
- Consider obtaining accurate assessment of CTPA images used to diagnose PE, individual risk factors for CTEPH, symptoms of functional limitations and/or right HF in the course of PE to identify patients at risk of CTEPH. (E)
- Evaluate for CTEPH in patients with PE optimally at the routine 3-month follow-up visit, but consider obtaining earlier work-up in highly symptomatic or deteriorating patients. (E)

As per CCS/CTS 2020 guidelines:

- Assess for CTEPH with echocardiography and V/Q lung scan in patients with residual dyspnea or exercise intolerance after at least 3 months of uninterrupted anticoagulation post-acute PE. (B)
- Assess the possibility of CTEPH with initial V/Q lung scan in patients being evaluated for pulmonary hypertension. (B)

As per AHA 2011 guidelines:

- Obtain evaluation for CTEPH in patients presenting with unexplained dyspnea, exercise intolerance, or clinical evidence of right-sided HF, with or without prior history of symptomatic VTE. (B)
- Consider obtaining echocardiography 6 weeks after an acute PE to screen for persistent pulmonary hypertension to predict the development of CTEPH. (C)

## Diagnostic Investigations

### Echocardiography
As per ERS 2021 guidelines, obtain echocardiography as the test of choice in patients with suspected CTEPH. Consider using the Leiden CTEPH rule-out criteria to exclude the presence of CTEPH and/or to establish an alternative diagnosis. (E)

### Perfusion Imaging
As per ERS/ESC 2022 guidelines:
- Obtain V/Q or perfusion lung scan to assess for CTEPH in patients with unexplained pulmonary hypertension. (B)

As per ERS 2021 guidelines:
- Obtain V/Q scintigraphy as the most effective screening tool to exclude CTEPD. Consider obtaining V/Q SPECT over planar imaging. Consider reprojecting 3D planar images from SPECT because the transition from planar imaging to SPECT may not be easy for clinicians unfamiliar with the 3D anatomy. (E)
- Do not favor alternative perfusion techniques (such as dual-energy CT and magnetic resonance perfusion) over V/Q because they are more technically challenging and expensive with limited availability and lacking multicenter validation. (D)

As per CTS 2010 guidelines:
- Obtain nuclear V/Q lung scanning instead of CTPA as a screening test to rule out the possibility of CTEPH in patients diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension. (B)
- Consider ruling out the possibility of CTEPH by a normal V/Q. **[Evidence Level: ⁄]**
- Do not use the results of V/Q testing to assess the anatomical extent of potentially surgically accessible CTEPH. (D)

### Pulmonary Angiography
As per ERS/ESC 2022 guidelines:
- Obtain CTPA in the evaluation of patients with suspected CTEPH. (B)
- Consider obtaining digital subtraction angiography in the evaluation of patients with CTEPH. (C)

As per ERS 2021 guidelines:
- Obtain high-quality CTPA for the diagnosis of proximal CTEPH. (E)
- Do not exclude CTEPH with a negative CTPA, even if high-quality, as distal disease can be missed. (D)
- Insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of cone beam CT and area detector CT, recognizing that they allow more accurate visualization of subsegmental vasculature and have been shown to be useful for procedural guidance for balloon pulmonary angioplasty. (I)
- Recognize that MRI is not fully integrated into the CTEPH diagnostic algorithm, because its use is heavily dependent on local practice and is routinely implemented only in a few high-volume institutions where there is clustering of expertise. (E)

As per CTS 2010 guidelines:
- Consider obtaining positive CTPA routinely to assess the anatomical extent of surgically accessible CTEPH. (C)
- Do not rule out the presence of surgically accessible CTEPH by a negative CTPA and consider obtaining contrast pulmonary angiography. **[Evidence Level: ⁄]**
- Avoid obtaining routine magnetic resonance pulmonary angiography in the preoperative assessment of patients with CTEPH. (D)

### Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing
As per ERS 2021 guidelines:
- Consider obtaining cardiopulmonary exercise testing to exclude the presence of CTEPH and/or to establish an alternative diagnosis. (E)
- Consider obtaining cardiopulmonary exercise testing and exercise-right heart catheterization to contribute to the definition of CTEPD helping to identify the main cause of exercise limitation in the presence of comorbidities and in patients without resting pulmonary hypertension. (E)

### Antiphospholipid Antibodies
As per ERS/ESC 2022 guidelines, obtain testing for antiphospholipid syndrome in patients with CTEPH. (B)

## Diagnostic Procedures

### Right Heart Catheterization
As per CCS/CTS 2020 guidelines, perform right heart catheterization in all patients with suspected CTEPH to confirm the hemodynamic diagnosis of precapillary pulmonary hypertension and to assess the severity of pulmonary hypertension. (B)

## Respiratory Support

### Supplemental Oxygen
As per CTS 2010 guidelines:
- Administer supplemental oxygen in patients with CTEPH exhibiting hypoxemia at rest. **[Evidence Level: ⁄]**
- Insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of supplemental oxygen in patients with CTEPH manifesting isolated nocturnal and/or exertional oxygen desaturation. (I)

## Medical Management

### General Principles
As per ERS/ESC 2022 guidelines:
- Review all patients with CTEPH by a CTEPH team for the assessment of multimodal management. (B)
- Consider offering a multimodality approach in patients with persistent pulmonary hypertension after pulmonary endarterectomy and in patients with inoperable CTEPH. (C)

As per ERS 2021 guidelines:
- Ensure a multidisciplinary team approach considering pulmonary endarterectomy, medical therapy and balloon pulmonary angioplasty for optimal treatment of patients with CTEPH. (E)
- Insufficient evidence to recommend any eligibility criteria for multimodal therapy, which is dependent on the expertise and judgment of each individual CTEPH center. Conduct patient selection for multimodal therapy in expert centers through a multidisciplinary team approach. (I)

As per CCS/CTS 2020 guidelines:
- Refer all potential CTEPH patients to a local expert pulmonary hypertension center for the establishment of a formal diagnosis of CTEPH and assessment for the most appropriate treatment. (B)

As per ERS 2021 guidelines:
- Initiate lifelong anticoagulation, with VKAs as the mainstay of anticoagulant therapy, in patients with CTEPH. (E)
- Recognize that DOACs are increasingly used, with no safety issues reported yet. Do not use DOACs in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. (E)

As per AHA 2011 guidelines:
- Initiate indefinite therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with objectively proven CTEPH, if not contraindicated. (B)

As per CTS 2010 guidelines:
- Initiate chronic anticoagulants in all patients with CTEPH, including patients not undergoing pulmonary endarterectomy and patients after pulmonary endarterectomy. (B)

### Other Medications

## Nonpharmacologic Interventions

### Rehabilitation
As per ERS 2021 guidelines:
- Offer rehabilitation, in hospital or home-based settings, in patients with inoperable CTEPH. (E)

## Therapeutic Procedures

### Balloon Pulmonary Angioplasty
As per ERS/ESC 2022 guidelines:
- Consider performing balloon pulmonary angioplasty in technically operable patients with a high proportion of distal disease and an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio for pulmonary endarterectomy. (C)
- Perform balloon pulmonary angioplasty in technically inoperable patients or in patients with residual pulmonary hypertension after pulmonary endarterectomy and distal obstructions amenable to balloon pulmonary angioplasty. (B)
- Consider initiating medical therapy before balloon pulmonary angioplasty. (C)

As per ERS 2021 guidelines:
- Insufficient evidence regarding the role of balloon pulmonary angioplasty as bridging therapy before pulmonary endarterectomy in patients with mixed surgically accessible and inaccessible lesions. (I)
- Insufficient evidence regarding the potential benefit of hybrid procedures simultaneously combining pulmonary endarterectomy and balloon pulmonary angioplasty in patients with mixed surgically accessible and inaccessible lesions. (I)
- Insufficient evidence to recommend balloon pulmonary angioplasty as a rescue procedure for early failure of pulmonary endarterectomy. (I)
- Recognize that additional balloon pulmonary angioplasty, most often in combination with pulmonary hypertension-targeted medical therapy, is common practice in patients with persistent symptomatic pulmonary hypertension after pulmonary endarterectomy. (E)
- Insufficient evidence to recommend preprocedural pulmonary hypertension-targeted therapy to improve the safety of balloon pulmonary angioplasty. (I)
- Recognize that safety and efficacy of balloon pulmonary angioplasty correlates with center experience. (E)

### IVC Filter Placement
As per CTS 2010 guidelines:
- Insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the routine use of IVC filters in patients with CTEPH. (I)

## Perioperative Care

### Preoperative Pharmacotherapy
As per ERS 2021 guidelines:
- Insufficient evidence that preoperative pharmacotherapy is beneficial in patients with operable CTEPH. Consider initiating pulmonary hypertension-targeted drugs as bridging therapy to pulmonary endarterectomy in selected high-risk patients (with high preoperative pulmonary vascular resistance) after multidisciplinary team assessment in expert centers. (I)

As per CTS 2010 guidelines:
- Consider initiating pre-pulmonary endarterectomy treatment with IV epoprostenol in selected patients with severe surgically accessible CTEPH (WHO functional class III or IV with a pulmonary vascular resistance > 1200 dyn•s/cm⁵ and/or RV failure) to improve hemodynamics and operability. (C)
- Decide on instituting pre-pulmonary endarterectomy parenteral epoprostenol therapy at the discretion of a center with experience in treating patients with CTEPH and in consultation with a pulmonary endarterectomy surgeon. **[Evidence Level: ⁄]**
- Insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of oral pulmonary hypertension-specific medical therapy in patients with CTEPH being considered for pulmonary endarterectomy. Do not delay referral to an expert center for consideration of pulmonary endarterectomy in patients with surgically accessible CTEPH because of the decision to treat patients with CTEPH with oral pulmonary hypertension medications because such a delay may adversely impact the clinical outcome. (I)

## Surgical Interventions

### Pulmonary Endarterectomy
As per ERS/ESC 2022 guidelines:
- Perform pulmonary endarterectomy as the treatment of choice in patients with CTEPH and fibrotic obstructions within pulmonary arteries accessible by surgery. (B)

As per ERS 2021 guidelines:
- Consider performing surgery for segmental and subsegmental disease in expert, high-volume centers, recognizing that there is probably considerable anatomical overlap between balloon pulmonary angioplasty and pulmonary endarterectomy. (E)
- Recognize that successful outcome after pulmonary endarterectomy is multifactorial and assumes in-hospital mortality < 5%, survival of 90% at 3 years, improved functional class and QoL. (E)
- Recognize that residual pulmonary hypertension after pulmonary endarterectomy presents in ∼ 50% and represents a target for recently introduced medical therapies and balloon pulmonary angioplasty. Consider offering pharmacotherapy and balloon pulmonary angioplasty if post-pulmonary endarterectomy mean pulmonary arterial pressure remains > 30 mmHg in the presence of symptoms. (E)
- Consider ensuring ≥ 50 cases/year and a properly trained surgeon for centers performing pulmonary endarterectomy. (E)

As per CCS/CTS 2020 guidelines:
- Evaluate all patients with CTEPH for pulmonary endarterectomy in consultation with a pulmonary endarterectomy center. (B)

As per AHA 2011 guidelines:
- Obtain prompt evaluation for pulmonary endarterectomy in patients with objectively proven CTEPH, even if symptoms are mild. (B)

As per CTS 2010 guidelines:
- Perform pulmonary endarterectomy as the treatment of choice in patients with surgically-accessible CTEPH. (B)
- Consider performing pulmonary endarterectomy in patients with distal CTEPH on an individual basis at a center experienced with pulmonary endarterectomy. (C)

### Lung Transplantation
As per CCS/CTS 2020 guidelines:
- Refer patients with CTEPH with persistent severe pulmonary hypertension (NYHA class III or IV, and/or RV failure) despite maximal medical therapy for lung transplantation assessment. (B)

As per CTS 2010 guidelines:
- Refer inoperable patients with CTEPH or patients experiencing residual pulmonary hypertension post-pulmonary endarterectomy and remaining in WHO functional class III or IV despite optimal medical therapy for evaluation for lung transplantation. (B)
- Ensure early referral as there can be significant delays until transplantation. **[Evidence Level: ⁄]**

## Follow-up and Surveillance

### Post-PEA Management, Pharmacotherapy
As per ERS/ESC 2022 guidelines:
- Initiate riociguat in symptomatic patients with persistent or recurrent pulmonary hypertension after pulmonary endarterectomy. (B)
- Consider initiating treprostinil SC in patients with persistent or recurrent pulmonary hypertension after pulmonary endarterectomy. (C)

As per ERS 2021 guidelines:
- Initiate riociguat (an oral guanylate cyclase stimulator) or treprostinil (a subcutaneous prostacyclin analog) in patients with inoperable CTEPH or persistent/recurrent pulmonary hypertension after pulmonary endarterectomy. (E)

As per CCS/CTS 2020 guidelines:
- Initiate riociguat monotherapy in all patients with residual/recurrent CTEPH post-pulmonary endarterectomy. (B)

As per CTS 2010 guidelines:

  - Endothelin receptor antagonist (bosentan)
  - PDE5 inhibitor (sildenafil)
  - Parenteral prostanoid (IV epoprostenol or subcutaneous/IV treprostinil), if oral pulmonary hypertension-specific therapy was ineffective or not tolerated (C)
- Insufficient evidence to assess the potential benefits of other endothelin receptor antagonists (such as sitaxsentan and ambrisentan), other phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (such as tadalafil and vardenafil) and oral (such as beraprost) or inhaled (such as iloprost or treprostinil) prostanoids in patients with CTEPH. (I)
