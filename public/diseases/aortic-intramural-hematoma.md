# Aortic Intramural Hematoma

## Background

### Definition
Aortic IMH is a condition characterized by bleeding within the wall of the aorta without an entrance tear.

### Pathophysiology
The pathophysiology of aortic IMH involves two main mechanisms: extension of aortic dissection and primary intimal tear with hematoma propagation.

### Epidemiology
The incidence of aortic IMH is estimated at 1.2 per 100,000 person-years.

### Disease course
Clinically, patients with aortic IMH often present with sudden, severe, and persistent chest or back pain. Complications include progression to aortic dissection or rupture.

### Prognosis and risk of recurrence
The prognosis of aortic IMH can vary based on factors such as the extent and location of the hematoma. It usually carries a lower mortality rate than aortic dissection.

## Guidelines

### Key sources
The following summarized guidelines for the evaluation and management of aortic intramural hematoma are prepared by our editorial team based on guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC 2024), the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS/EACTS 2024), the American Heart Association (AHA/ACC 2022), the American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS 2021), and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI/STS/SVM/AATS/SCA/AHA/ACR/ACC/ASA/SIR ...)

## Clinical findings

### Symptoms
- Acute back pain
- Sudden chest pain

### Vital signs
- Hypertension
- Hypotension

### Past medical history
- Aortic aneurysm
- Hypertension

## Classification and risk stratification
As per EACTS/STS 2024 guidelines, Consider using the TEM classification in any acute aortic syndrome to identify the disease type and establish an initial treatment strategy. (C)

## Diagnostic investigations

### Aortic imaging
As per ESC 2024 guidelines:
- Obtain ECG-gated cardiovascular CT from neck to pelvis as first-line imaging technique in patients with suspected acute aortic syndrome. (B)
- Consider obtaining cardiovascular MRI as an alternative if cardiovascular CT is not available in patients with suspected acute aortic syndrome. (C)

### Echocardiography
As per ESC 2024 guidelines:
- Obtain focused TTE (with contrast if feasible) during the initial evaluation in patients with suspected acute aortic syndrome. (B)
- Perform TEE to guide perioperative management and detect complications in patients with suspected acute aortic syndrome. (B)

## Medical management
