# Blunt Cardiac Injury

## Background

### Overview

#### **Definition**
BCI refers to an injury sustained due to blunt trauma to the heart, the spectrum of which ranges from a minor bruise to specific post-contusion cardiac conditions such as free-wall rupture.¹

#### **Pathophysiology**
BCI is mostly caused by motor vehicle accidents, falls from heights, direct blow to the chest wall by airbag deployment, crushing incidents, contact sports injuries, acts of violence, or blast trauma.¹

#### **Disease Course**
Clinical manifestations include arrhythmias, myocardial contusion, wall motion abnormalities, myocardial wall rupture, and valve damage. The spectrum of injuries includes commotio cordis, cardiac rupture, coronary artery dissection, indirect cardiac injury, cardiac herniation, pericardial effusion and tamponade, traumatic cardiac arrest, and blunt aortic injury.¹

#### **Prognosis and Risk of Recurrence**
BCI is associated with an overall mortality rate of 13.9%.²

## Guidelines

### Key Sources
The following summarized guidelines for the evaluation and management of blunt cardiac injury are prepared by our editorial team based on guidelines from the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP 2024), the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST/WTA/PTS 2023), the American College of Radiology (ACR 2020), and the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST 2015,2012).¹ ² ³ ⁴ ⁵ ⁶ ⁷

## Clinical Findings

### Symptoms
- Chest pain

### Vital Signs
- Hypotension

### Past Medical History
- DVT
- Pericardial tamponade
- Traumatic injury

## Studies

### 2025 • TRAUMOX2
In adult patients with blunt or penetrating trauma, restrictive oxygen strategy was not superior to liberal oxygen strategy with respect to the rate of death and/or major respiratory complications within 30 days.
*Tobias Arleth et al. JAMA. 2025 Feb 11.*

### 2024 • VIDLARECO
In intubated critically ill patients, videolaryngoscope insertion technique was superior to conventional insertion technique with respect to successful TEE probe insertion on the first attempt.

## Screening and Diagnosis

### Indications for Testing
As per EAST 2012 guidelines, Avoid implementing cardiac monitoring on the sole basis of a sternal fracture, in patients in whom ECG and troponin I levels are normal. (D)

## Classification and Risk Stratification

### Risk Stratification
As per ACEP 2024 guidelines:
- Use clinical judgment and hospital-specific protocols to decide between selective CT and whole-body CT in hemodynamically stable adult patients with blunt trauma. (B)
- Take into account age (> 65 years) for triage of older adult patients with trauma, as they have increased morbidity and mortality compared with similarly injured adults. (B)

As per EAST 2012 guidelines, Admit patients for continuous ECG monitoring if the admission ECG reveals a new abnormality, such as arrhythmias, ST changes, ischemia, or heart block. (B)

## Diagnostic Investigations

### ECG
As per EAST 2012 guidelines, Obtain an admission ECG in all patients in whom BCI is suspected. (A)

### Continuous ECG Monitoring
As per EAST 2012 guidelines, Admit patients for continuous ECG monitoring if the admission ECG reveals a new abnormality such as arrhythmia, ST changes, ischemia, heart block, and unexplained ST changes. Compare with a previous ECG to determine need for monitoring in patients with preexisting abnormalities. (B)

### Troponin I
As per EAST 2012 guidelines, Measure troponin I routinely for patients with suspected BCI; if elevated, admit patients to a monitored setting and follow troponin I serially, although the optimal timing is unknown. (B)

### CK
As per EAST 2012 guidelines, Avoid obtaining CK with isoenzyme analysis, because it is not beneficial in predicting which patients have or will have complications related to BCI. (D)

### Cardiac Imaging
As per ACR 2020 guidelines, Obtain a TTE in patients (either hemodynamically stable or unstable) with suspected cardiac injury following blunt chest trauma. (B)

As per EAST 2012 guidelines:
- Obtain a TTE in patients with hemodynamic instability or persistent new arrhythmia. Obtain a TEE if an optimal TTE cannot be obtained. (B)
- Obtain cardiac CT or MRI to help differentiate acute myocardial infarction from BCI in trauma patients with abnormal ECG, cardiac enzymes, and/or abnormal echocardiography. (B)

### Chest Imaging
As per ACR 2020 guidelines:
- Obtain a CXR and chest CT with IV contrast or chest CTA as complementary first-line imaging modalities in hemodynamically stable patients with suspected cardiac injury following blunt chest trauma. (B)
- Obtain a CXR, chest CT with IV contrast, chest CTA, and cardiac CT with IV contrast as complementary imaging modalities in hemodynamically unstable patients with suspected cardiac injury following blunt chest trauma. (B)

### Nuclear Medicine Studies
As per EAST 2012 guidelines, Avoid routinely obtaining nuclear medicine studies in patients with BCI, as they provide little additional information when compared with echocardiography. (D)

## Therapeutic Procedures

### Blood Product Transfusion
As per ACEP 2024 guidelines, Use a FFP:platelet:packed RBCs ratio from 1:1:1 to 1:1:1.5 in adult patients presenting to the emergency department with blunt trauma to reduce 24-hour mortality without increasing morbidity. (B)

## Surgical Interventions

### Resuscitative Thoracotomy, Adult Patients
As per EAST 2015 guidelines:
- Consider performing emergency department thoracotomy in patients presenting pulseless to the emergency department after blunt injury with signs of life. (C)
- Avoid performing emergency department thoracotomy in patients presenting pulseless to the emergency department after blunt injury without signs of life. (D)

### Resuscitative Thoracotomy, Pediatric Patients
As per EAST/PTS/WTA 2023 guidelines:
- Consider performing emergency department thoracotomy following emergency adjuncts, including ultrasound and thoracostomies, to determine injury location and/or reversible causes of shock in pediatric patients presenting pulseless to the emergency department after blunt injury with signs of life. (C)
- Do not perform emergency department thoracotomy in pediatric patients presenting pulseless to the emergency department after blunt injury without signs of life. (D)

### REBOA
As per ACEP 2024 guidelines, Do not perform resuscitative endovascular balloon aortic occlusion over resuscitative thoracotomy routinely in adult patients with blunt trauma in cardiac arrest or periarrest. (D)

## Specific Circumstances

### Patients Requiring Surgical Interventions
As per EAST 2012 guidelines, Consider proceeding with surgery in elderly patients with known cardiac disease, unstable patients, and those with an abnormal admission ECG, provided that they are appropriately monitored. Consider placing a pulmonary artery catheter in these situations. (C)
