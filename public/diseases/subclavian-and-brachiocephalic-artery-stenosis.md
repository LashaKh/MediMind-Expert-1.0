# Subclavian and Brachiocephalic Artery Stenosis

## Studies

Subclavian Stenosis Prognosis Study
The landmark study by [Aboyans et al. (2007)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17418292/) demonstrated that subclavian stenosis is associated with increased total and cardiovascular mortality, highlighting the vital prognostic importance of this condition.

Prevalence and Risk Factors Study
The [Shadman et al. (2004)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15358030/) study provided important insights into the prevalence, risk factors, and association with cardiovascular diseases in subclavian artery stenosis.

## Background

### Definition
Subclavian and brachiocephalic artery stenosis refers to the narrowing of these arteries, typically due to atherosclerosis or arterial dissection.

### Pathophysiology
Subclavian and brachiocephalic artery stenosis can lead to decreased blood flow and impaired oxygen delivery to the upper extremities and brain.

### Epidemiology
The epidemiology of subclavian and brachiocephalic artery stenosis is not well-defined due to their relative rarity, and prevalence and incidence rates are not explicitly reported.

### Disease Course
Clinical manifestations include symptoms of lightheadedness, syncope, left-sided weakness, subclavian steal syndrome, and arm claudication.

### Prognosis and Risk of Recurrence
The prognosis can be severe if left untreated. Subclavian stenosis is associated with increased total and CVD mortality, even after adjustments for CVD risk factors and existent CVD at baseline.

## Guidelines

### Key Sources

The following summarized guidelines for the evaluation and management of subclavian and brachiocephalic artery stenosis are prepared by our editorial team based on guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC/ESVS 2018) and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI/SNIS/SVM/AANS/ASNR/CNS/AANN/SVS/AHA/ACR/SAIP/ACC/ASA/SIR 2011).

## Clinical Findings

### Symptoms
- Claudication of upper limb
- Dysarthria
- Syncope
- Upper extremity pain with movement
- Vertigo
- Visual disturbances

### Social History
- Current cigarette smoking

### Past Medical History
- Atherosclerotic disease
- Hypercholesterolemia
- TIA

## Screening and Diagnosis

### Indications for Screening

**ESC/ESVS 2018 guidelines:**

- Screen for PAD of lower and upper extremities in patients undergoing TAVI or other structural interventions requiring an arterial approach. (B)

- Obtain full vascular assessment in all patients being candidates for heart transplantation or cardiac assist device implantation. (B)

## Diagnostic Investigations

### Diagnostic Imaging

As per AANN/AANS/ACC/…/SVS 2011 guidelines,  
Obtain CTA or MRA for detection of vertebral artery disease as part of the initial evaluation of patients with subclavian steal syndrome. (B)

## Medical Management

### Management of Hypertension

**ESC/ESVS 2018 guidelines:**

- Target controlling BP at < 140/90 mmHg in patients with PAD and hypertension. (A)

- Consider offering ACEis or ARBs as first-line therapy in patients with PAD and hypertension. (C)

### Management of Dyslipidemia

**ESC/ESVS 2018 guidelines:**

- Offer statins in all patients with PADs. (A)

- Target reducing LDL-C to < 1.8 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL) or decreasing it by ≥ 50% if baseline values are 1.8-3.5 mmol/L (70-135 mg/dL). (B)

### Management of Diabetes Mellitus

**ESC/ESVS 2018 guidelines** Obtain strict glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus and PAD. (B)

## Nonpharmacologic Interventions

### Lifestyle Modifications

**ESC/ESVS 2018 guidelines** Advise smoking cessation, (B) healthy diet and physical activity in all patients with PADs. (B)

## Therapeutic Procedures

### Indications for Revascularization

**ESC/ESVS 2018 guidelines:**

- Consider performing revascularization in symptomatic patients with subclavian artery stenosis/occlusion. (C)

- Consider performing revascularization by either surgery or stenting in symptomatic patients with subclavian artery stenosis/occlusion, and discuss the choice of method case-by-case according to the lesion characteristics and patient's risk. (C)

**Consider performing revascularization in asymptomatic patients with subclavian artery stenosis in the following cases:**

- proximal stenosis in patients undergoing CABG using the ipsilateral internal mammary artery (C)
- proximal stenosis in patients already having the ipsilateral internal mammary artery grafted to coronary arteries with evidence of myocardial ischemia (C)
- subclavian artery stenosis and ipsilateral arteriovenous fistula for dialysis (C)
- bilateral stenosis in order to be able to monitor BP accurately (C)

### Endovascular Revascularization

As per AANN/AANS/ACC/…/SVS 2011 guidelines:

- Consider performing percutaneous angioplasty and stenting in patients with symptomatic anterior cerebral ischemia caused by brachiocephalic artery occlusive disease. (C)

- Consider performing percutaneous angioplasty and stenting in patients with symptomatic posterior cerebral or cerebellar ischemia caused by subclavian artery stenosis (subclavian steal syndrome) being at high risk of surgical complications. (C)

- Consider performing percutaneous angioplasty and stenting in patients with symptomatic ischemia involving upper-extremity claudication caused by subclavian or brachiocephalic arterial occlusive disease. (C)

- Consider performing revascularization by subclavian angioplasty and stenting in asymptomatic patients with subclavian artery stenosis when the ipsilateral internal mammary artery is required as a conduit for myocardial revascularization. (C)

## Surgical Interventions

### Surgical Revascularization

As per AANN/AANS/ACC/…/SVS 2011 guidelines:

- Consider performing revascularization by direct arterial reconstruction or extra-anatomic bypass surgery in patients with symptomatic ischemia involving the anterior cerebral circulation caused by common carotid or brachiocephalic artery occlusive disease. (C)

- Consider performing extra-anatomic carotid-subclavian bypass surgery in patients with symptomatic posterior cerebral or cerebellar ischemia caused by subclavian artery stenosis or occlusion (subclavian steal syndrome) in the absence of clinical factors predisposing to surgical morbidity or mortality. (C)

- Consider performing revascularization by direct arterial reconstruction or extra-anatomic bypass surgery in patients with symptomatic ischemia involving upper extremity claudication caused by subclavian or brachiocephalic arterial occlusive disease. (C)

- Consider performing revascularization by extra-anatomic bypass surgery in asymptomatic patients with subclavian artery stenosis when the ipsilateral internal mammary artery is required as a conduit for myocardial revascularization. (C)

- Do not perform revascularization in asymptomatic patients with asymmetrical upper extremity BP, periclavicular bruit, or flow reversal in a vertebral artery caused by subclavian artery stenosis unless the internal mammary artery is required for myocardial revascularization. (D)

## Quality Improvement

### Hospital Requirements

As per ESC/ESVS 2018 guidelines,
 Healthcare centers should set up a multidisciplinary vascular team to make decisions for the management of patients with PADs. (B)
