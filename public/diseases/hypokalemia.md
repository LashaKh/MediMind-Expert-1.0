# Hypokalemia


## Background

### Overview

#### **Definition**
Hypokalemia refers to the presence of serum potassium levels < 3.6 mmol/L.

#### **Pathophysiology**
Potassium depletion occurs due to inadequate dietary intake, increased renal excretion (e.g., due to diuretic therapy), or increased gastrointestinal losses in the context of diarrhea.

#### **Epidemiology**
Hypokalemia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in clinical practice.

#### **Disease course**
Manifestations of hypokalemia include muscle weakness, ileus, and cardiac arrhythmias. Typical electrocardiographic changes include flat or inverted T waves, ST-segment depression, and prominent U waves.

#### **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**
Severe untreated hypokalemia can lead to rhabdomyolysis and malignant cardiac arrhythmias, such as VT and VF.

## Guidelines

### Key sources
The following summarized guidelines for the evaluation and management of hypokalemia are prepared by our editorial team based on guidelines from the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP 2023,2015) and the National Council on Potassium in Clinical Practice (NCPCP 2000).

## Clinical Findings

### Symptoms
- Diarrhea
- Muscle cramps
- Muscle weakness
- Poorly localized abdominal pain
- Sweating
- Vomiting

### Social history
- Alcohol consumption

### Past medical history
- CKD
- Cushing's syndrome
- Medications
- Primary aldosteronism

## Diagnostic Investigations

### Measurement of potassium levels
As per NCPCP 2000 guidelines:
- Use serum potassium as the most convenient laboratory test to establish the diagnosis of hypokalemia, recognizing that it is not always an accurate indicator of total body potassium. (E)
- Consider measurement of 24-hour urinary potassium excretion as a more appropriate indicator of total body potassium in patients who are at high risk of complications from hypokalemia, such as those with HF. (E)

## Medical Management

### General principles
As per NCPCP 2000 guidelines:
- Initiate potassium replacement in individuals who are subject to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bulimia, or diuretic/laxative abuse. (E)
- Administer potassium supplements PO in a moderate dosage over a period of days to weeks to achieve full repletion of potassium. (E)

### Oral potassium replacement
As per NCPCP 2000 guidelines:
- Consider using a dosage of 20 mmol/day of potassium in oral form for the prevention of hypokalemia. (E)
- Consider using a dosage of 40 to 100 mmol/day of potassium in oral form for the treatment of hypokalemia. (E)
- Intravenous potassium replacement: as per AAFP 2023 guidelines, reserve IV potassium for patients with severe hypokalemia, ECG changes, physical signs or symptoms of hypokalemia, or inability to tolerate oral potassium supplementation. (B)

### Optimization of patient adherence
As per NCPCP 2000 guidelines:
- Use the simplest regimen possible for potassium supplementation, in order to optimize long-term compliance. (E)
- Consider using compliance-enhancing regimens, such as microencapsulated potassium, in order to increase patient adherence to potassium supplementation. (E)

## Inpatient Care

### ECG monitoring: 
As per AAFP 2015 guidelines, Consider ECG monitoring in patients with severe hypokalemia (serum potassium < 2.5 mmol/L). (C)

## Nonpharmacologic Interventions

### Dietary considerations: 
As per NCPCP 2000 guidelines, Initiate potassium replacement therapy in combination with dietary consumption of potassium-rich foods. (E)

## Specific Circumstances

### Patients with diabetes mellitus
As per NCPCP 2000 guidelines: monitor potassium levels closely in patients with diabetes mellitus, and initiate potassium replacement therapy when appropriate. (E)

### Patients with hypertension
As per NCPCP 2000 guidelines:
- Initiate potassium supplementation in patients with drug-related hypokalemia (such as therapy with a non-potassium-sparing diuretic). (E)
- Maintain serum potassium levels ≥ 4.0 mmol/L in patients with asymptomatic hypertension. Dietary consumption of potassium-rich foods and potassium supplementation should be instituted as necessary.(E)

### Patients with heart disease
As per AAFP 2015 guidelines, Maintain serum potassium levels ≥ 4.0 mmol/L in patients with a history of congestive HF or myocardial infarction. (B)
As per NCPCP 2000 guidelines, Consider potassium supplementation routinely in patients with HF, even if the initial potassium determination appears to be normal. (E)

### Patients with cardiac arrhythmias
As per NCPCP 2000 guidelines: Maintain serum potassium levels ≥ 4.0 mmol/L in patients with cardiac arrhythmias. (E)

### Patients at risk of stroke
As per NCPCP 2000 guidelines: Consider maintaining optimal potassium levels in patients at high risk for stroke, including those with a history of atherosclerotic or hemorrhagic cerebral vascular accidents. (E)
