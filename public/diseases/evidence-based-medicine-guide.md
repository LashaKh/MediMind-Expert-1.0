# Evidence-Based Medicine Guide

## Introduction

Levels of evidence help you to target your search at the type of evidence that is most likely to provide a reliable answer. It has been designed so that it can be used as a shortcut for busy clinicians, researchers, or patients to find the likely best evidence.

Grades of evidence describe the strength and therefore value of the evidence relative to how rigorous the study was.

## Clinical Application

What are we to do when the irresistible force of the need to offer clinical advice meets with the immovable object of flawed evidence? All we can do is our best: give the advice, but alert the advisees to the flaws in the evidence on which it is based.

This has been adapted from Sackett, Straus and Richardson (2000).
