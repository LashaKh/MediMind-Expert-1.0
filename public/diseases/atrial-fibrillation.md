## Background

### Overview

#### **Definition**
AF is a cardiac arrhythmia characterized by a diffuse and abnormal pattern of electrical activity in the atria of the heart. AF is classified as valvular or nonvalvular based on the presence or absence of valvular heart disease, specifically MS, or a prosthetic heart valve.

#### **Pathophysiology**
The development of AF is related to structural and electrophysiological abnormalities resulting from comorbid conditions (including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, myocardial infarction, HF), genetics, sex, and other factors.

#### **Epidemiology**
The prevalence of AF in the US ranges is estimated at 700-775 cases per 100,000 persons.

#### **Disease course**
In patients with AF, rapid and irregular atrial contractions lead to tachyarrhythmias, which lead to symptoms of palpitations, dyspnea, and an increased risk of HF; as well as stasis of blood in the LAA, which increases the risk of stroke and systemic embolism.

#### **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**
AF is estimated to cause 15% of all strokes and is associated with a 5-fold increased risk of stroke and a 2-fold risk for all-cause mortality, respectively.

### Indications for screening, stroke:

**As per ACC 2025 guidelines:**
- Consider obtaining rhythm monitoring in patients with stroke from presumed cardioembolic origin only if there is consideration of stopping anticoagulation or there are other treatment decisions that depend on arrhythmia detection. (E)
- Consider obtaining rhythm monitoring in patients with ischemic stroke from presumed small- or large-vessel disease for 2-4 weeks. Initiate oral anticoagulation when an AF event ≥ 5 minutes is identified. (E)
- Consider obtaining extended monitoring with an implantable cardiac monitor in patients with ischemic stroke from presumed small- or large-vessel diseased, especially in patients with higher risk criteria for the development of AF. (E)
- Offer cardiac monitoring for 2-4 weeks in patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source eligible for long-term anticoagulation if AF is identified. (E)
- Consider offering an implantable monitor in selected patients with higher risk of post-stroke AF among those with a recent embolic stroke of undetermined source and no identified cause by external monitoring. (E)
- Consider initiating anticoagulation in patients with AF events ≥ 5 minutes, particularly in patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 3 or equivalent stroke risk. (E)
- Do not use anticoagulation in patients with a very low burden of AF (< 5 minutes) without other indications. (D)

**As per ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines:**
- Consider obtaining implantable cardiac monitoring in patients with a history of a systemic thromboembolic event without a known history of AF if maximum sensitivity to detect AF is sought. (C)

**As per CCS/CHRS 2020 guidelines:**
Obtain downstream confirmatory testing when AF is suspected but not documented or when the documentation method does not include ECG rhythm acquisition. (B)

## Classification and Risk Stratification

### Stroke risk assessment:

**As per ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines:**
- Assess the annual risk of thromboembolic events using a validated clinical risk score, such as the CHA2DS2-VASc score, in patients with AF. (B)
- Take into consideration factors that might modify the risk of stroke to help inform the decision in patients with AF at intermediate annual risk of thromboembolic events (based on risk scores, such as equivalent to CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 in males or 2 in females) remaining uncertain about the benefit of anticoagulation. (B)

**As per EACTS/ESC 2021 guidelines:**
- Use the CHA2DS2-VASc clinical stroke risk score to initially identify patients at low risk of stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 in males and 1 in females) not being offered antithrombotic therapy. (AI)
- Obtain reassessment of stroke risk at periodic intervals to inform treatment decisions, such as initiation of OACs in patients no longer at low risk of stroke, and address potentially modifiable bleeding risk factors. (B)
- Obtain the first reassessment of stroke risk in patients with AF initially at low risk of stroke at 4-6 months after the index evaluation. (B)
