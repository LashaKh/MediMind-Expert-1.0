# Blood Gas Analysis

## Background

### Overview

#### **Definition**
Blood gas analysis is a common diagnostic tool to correctly interpret most of the respiratory, circulatory, and metabolic derangements through arterial and pulmonary/central venous blood gas and electrolyte analysis.

#### **Pathophysiology**
Blood gas analysis is used for the assessment of shunt fraction, pulmonary dead space, and respiratory, hemodynamic and metabolic relationship allowing for diagnosis and monitoring of critically ill patients.

#### **Disease course**
Blood gas analysis is performed either through the arterial, central venous, or dual sampling of blood to assess oxygenation status, ventilatory and respiratory status, metabolic acid-base equilibrium disorders helping in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients in emergency departments and ICUs.

#### **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**
Blood gas analysis is not associated with increased mortality.

## Guidelines

### Key sources
The following summarized guidelines for the evaluation of blood gas analysis are prepared by our editorial team based on guidelines from the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP 2025) and the American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC 2013).


## Clinical findings

### Symptoms
- Confusion
- Difficulty breathing
- Dyspnea
- Nausea

### Past events
- Head injury

### Past medical history
- CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease)
- Metabolic disorders


## Diagnostic investigations

### General principles:

As per AAFP 2025 guidelines:
- Use a systematic approach to evaluate acid-base disorders to provide vital diagnostic information and guide timely treatment in critically ill patients. (B)
- Obtain pH and pCO2 on blood gas to determine the primary process of an acid-base disorder. Recognize that abnormal values increasing or decreasing in the same direction indicate a metabolic process, while those shifting in opposite directions indicate a respiratory process. (B)
- Review expected patterns of pCO2 compensation for metabolic disturbances and bicarbonate compensation for respiratory disturbances when evaluating acid-base disorders to determine if an additional acid-base disorder is present. (B)

As per AARC 2013 guidelines:
- Obtain blood gas analysis and hemoximetry to evaluate a patient's ventilatory, acid-base, and/or oxygenation status. (A)
- Obtain blood gas analysis and hemoximetry to monitor the severity and progression of documented cardiopulmonary disease. (A)
- Consider obtaining blood gas analysis and hemoximetry to evaluate a patient's response to therapeutic interventions. (B)
- Consider obtaining hemoximetry for the detection and evaluation of shunts during diagnostic cardiac catheterization. (C)


## Assessment of oxygenation:

As per AARC 2013 guidelines:
- Avoid capillary blood gas analysis to determine oxygenation status. (D)
- Avoid using PvO2 as a substitute for PaO2. (D)
- Use hemoximetry to determine the impact of dyshemoglobinemia on oxygenation. (A)

### Assessment of ventilation

As per AARC 2013 guidelines:
- Avoid using venous PaCO2 and pH as a substitute for arterial blood measurement of PaCO2 and pH. (D)
