# Chest Pain

## Guidelines

### Key Sources

The following summarized guidelines for the evaluation and management of chest pain are prepared by our editorial team based on guidelines from the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP 2024,2021,2017) and the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT/SCMR/AHA/SAEM/ASE/ACC/ACCP 2021).

### Studies

**2022 • DISCHARGE**  
In patients with stable chest pain who had an intermediate pretest probability of obstructive coronary artery disease and were referred for invasive coronary angiography, CT was not superior to invasive coronary angiography with respect to the rate of composite outcome of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke over 3.5 years.  
*DISCHARGE Trial Group et al. N Engl J Med. 2022 Apr 28.*

## Classification and Risk Stratification

### Risk Stratification
**As per AAFP 2024 guidelines:** Use an appropriate clinical prediction tool for risk stratification in patients with acute chest discomfort (such as the HEART pathway) or stable chest discomfort (such as the CAD Consortium 2 calculator) to determine the need for further testing. (B)

## Diagnostic Investigations

### History and Physical Examination

**As per ACC/ACCP/AHA/…/SCMR 2021 guidelines:**

- Elicit a focused history including characteristics and duration of symptoms relative to presentation as well as associated features and assess cardiovascular risk factors in patients presenting with chest pain. (B)

- Obtain an initial assessment of chest pain to triage patients effectively on the basis of the likelihood that symptoms may be attributable to myocardial ischemia. (B)

- Do not describe chest pain as atypical, because it is not helpful in determining the cause and can be misinterpreted as benign in nature. Describe chest pain as cardiac, possibly cardiac or noncardiac, as these terms are more specific to the potential underlying diagnosis. (D)

- Consider assessing for cocaine and methamphetamine use in patients presenting with acute chest pain. (C)

- Recognize that females presenting with chest pain are at risk for underdiagnosis, therefore, always take into consideration potential cardiac causes. (B)

- Elicit a history in females presenting with chest pain emphasizing accompanying symptoms that are more common in female patients with ACS. (B)

- Suspect ACS in > 75 years old patients presenting with chest pain and accompanying symptoms, such as shortness of breath, syncope or acute delirium, or when an unexplained fall has occurred. (B)

- Perform a focused cardiovascular examination to aid in the diagnosis of ACS or other potentially serious causes of chest pain (aortic dissection, PE or esophageal rupture) and to identify complications in patients presenting with chest pain. (B)

### ECG

**As per ACC/ACCP/AHA/…/SCMR 2021 guidelines:**

- Obtain an ECG in patients seen in the office setting with stable chest pain unless a non-cardiac cause is evident. Refer patients to the emergency department for an ECG if it is unavailable in the office setting. (B)

- Obtain an ECG and review for ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction within 10 minutes of arrival in all patients presenting with acute chest pain, regardless of the setting. (B)

- Obtain serial ECGs to detect potential ischemic changes in patients with chest pain with an initial nondiagnostic ECG, especially when clinical suspicion of ACS is high, symptoms are persistent or the clinical condition deteriorates. (B)

- Consider using supplemental ECG leads V7-V9 to rule out posterior myocardial infarction in patients with chest pain and intermediate-to-high clinical suspicion for ACS if the initial ECG is nondiagnostic. (C)

### Troponin Levels

**As per ACC/ACCP/AHA/…/SCMR 2021 guidelines:**

- Obtain cardiac troponin as soon as possible after presentation in all patients presenting to the emergency department with acute chest pain and suspected ACS. (B)

- Consider obtaining serial cardiac troponin I or T levels to identify abnormal values and a rising or falling pattern indicative of acute myocardial injury in patients presenting with acute chest pain. (B)

- Obtain high-sensitivity cardiac troponin as the preferred biomarker because it enables more rapid detection or exclusion of myocardial injury and increases diagnostic accuracy in patients presenting with acute chest pain. (B)

- Ensure that clinicians are familiar with the analytical performance and the 99th percentile upper reference limit defining myocardial injury for the cardiac troponin assay used at their institution. (B)

- Recognize that with the availability of cardiac troponin, CK myocardial isoenzyme and myoglobin are not useful for diagnosis of acute myocardial injury. (B)

### Additional Diagnostic Tests
As per ACC/ACCP/AHA/…/SCMR 2021 guidelines,
**Transthoracic echocardiography:** obtain TTE in patients with acute chest pain with suspected other potentially life-threatening non-ischemic cardiac conditions (such as aortic pathology, pericardial effusion, endocarditis). (B)
As per ACC/ACCP/AHA/…/SCMR 2021 guidelines,
**Chest radiography:** consider obtaining CXR to evaluate for other potential cardiac, pulmonary, and thoracic causes of symptoms in patients presenting with acute chest pain. (B)
