## Studies

### 2018 • EPCAT II
In patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty or total knee arthroplasty and received once-daily oral rivaroxaban 10 mg until postoperative day 5, aspirin was noninferior to rivaroxaban with respect to VTE.
Anderson DR et al. N Engl J Med. 2018 Feb 22. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29467920/)

### 2015 • BRIDGE (atrial fibrillation)
In patients with AF who need an interruption in warfarin treatment (5 days before the procedure) for an elective operation or other elective invasive procedure, avoiding routine bridging was noninferior to routine bridging therapy with respect to arterial thromboembolism at 30 days after the procedure.

## Classification and risk stratification

### Risk assessment
As per ASIPP 2024 guidelines:

Use the following risk categorization of interventional techniques:

 **Low risk**
- Trigger point and intramuscular injections (including piriformis injection)
- Peripheral nerve blocks including mandibular and maxillary nerve blocks
- Sacroiliac joint and ligament injections and nerve blocks
- Facet joint interventions (intra-articular injections, medial branch and L5 dorsal ramus nerve blocks and radiofrequency neurotomy)
- Intraarticular injections of extremity joints
- Pocket revision and implantable pulse generator/intrathecal pump replacement
- Peripheral nerve stimulation trial and implantation
- Lumbar transforaminal epidural injections at L3, L4, L5, and S1
- Ganglion impar blocks
- Sacroiliac joint nerve radiofrequency
- Trigeminal branch nerve blocks (mandibular, maxillary, and other branches)

 **Intermediate risk**
- Caudal epidural injection
- Caudal epidural adhesiolysis
- Lumbar interlaminar epidural injection at L5, S1
- Cervical, thoracic, and lumbar transforaminal at L1 and L2

 **High risk**
- Cervical, thoracic, and lumbar (above L5) interlaminar epidurals
- Trigeminal ganglion, ophthalmic division, and sphenopalatine ganglion blocks
- Discography and intradiscal procedures (lumbosacral, cervical, and thoracic)
- Dorsal column and dorsal root ganglion stimulator trial and implantation
- Intrathecal catheter and pump implant
- Vertebral augmentation (sacral, lumbar, thoracic, and cervical)
- Percutaneous and endoscopic disc decompression procedures
- Minimally invasive lumbar decompression
- Trigeminal and cranial nerve blocks and stimulation
- Sympathetic blocks (stellate ganglion, thoracic sympathetic, splanchnic, celiac plexus, lumbar sympathetic, hypogastric plexus)
- Percutaneous adhesiolysis with interlaminar or transforaminal approach (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar)
- Intervertebral spinous prosthesis including lateral fusion
- Sacroiliac joint fusion
- Intracept procedure (B)

Additional guidelines:
- Upgrade risk stratification from low to intermediate and intermediate to high based on other risk factors. (B)
- Recognize that risk factors with severe degenerative arthritis with or without spinal stenosis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoporosis, older age, frailty, previous stroke, intracranial bleed, hypertension, diabetes, thrombocytopenia, chronic renal failure, chronic NSAIDs or corticosteroid therapy, multiple attempts, epidural fibrosis, and previous surgery may increase bleeding during the procedure and risk of epidural hematoma. (B)

## Diagnostic investigations

### Coagulation tests
As per SIR 2019 guidelines:
- Do not obtain screening coagulation laboratory testing in patients with minimal risk factors for bleeding undergoing procedures carrying low risk for bleeding. Consider obtaining coagulation testing in patients receiving warfarin or UFH or in patients with an inherently higher risk of bleeding. Correct INR to within the range of ≤ 2.0-3.0 and consider administering platelet transfusion if the platelet count is < 20×10⁹/L. Correct INR to < 1.8 for femoral access and < 2.2 for radial access in patients undergoing low bleeding risk procedures requiring arterial access. (D)
- Obtain appropriate preprocedural coagulation testing in patients undergoing procedures with high bleeding risk. Correct INR to within the range of ≤ 1.5-1.8 and consider administering platelet transfusion if the platelet count is < 50×10⁹/L. (B)

## Perioperative care

### General principles
As per ASIPP 2024 guidelines:
- Ensure a shared decision-making between the patient, the pain specialist, and the treating physicians if interruption of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy is contemplated for discussion of all the appropriate risks associated with continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy. (B)
- Restore or restart antithrombotic therapy during 12-24-hour period for intermediate-risk procedures, and low-risk procedures if the decision was made to hold based on risk factors, and 24-48 hours for major risk procedures, based on postoperative bleeding status. Consider resuming antithrombotic therapy 12 hours after interventional procedures if thromboembolic risk is high, with appropriate assessment and monitoring for clinically significant bleeding. (B)

As per SIR 2019 guidelines:
- Ensure a multidisciplinary, shared decision-making approach for planning periprocedural management in patients at high risk for thromboembolic or bleeding events. Involve specialists in cardiology, hematology, or vascular or internal medicine in order to provide optimal periprocedural medical management in high-risk patients. (B)

## Specific circumstances

### Patients with chronic liver disease
As per SIR 2019 guidelines:
- Administer plasma and platelet transfusion in patients with chronic liver disease judiciously because of rebalanced hemostasis and given the potential for increased portal pressure and transfusion-related adverse events. (E)
- Consider adjusting the INR and platelet count thresholds in patients with chronic liver disease undergoing invasive procedures to higher and lower, respectively, than in the general population to minimize unnecessary transfusions. Consider measuring the fibrinogen level and administering cryoprecipitate for replacement if the level is low. (E)

### Patients with AF, preprocedural interruption
As per CCS 2014 guidelines:
- Balance the risks of a thromboembolic event (as indicated by a higher CHADS2 score, mechanical heart valve, or rheumatic heart disease) against a bleeding event (as indicated by a higher HASBLED score and procedures with higher bleeding risks) in patients with atrial flutter/AF to decide on interrupting antithrombotic therapy for an invasive procedure. (B)
- Avoid interrupting anticoagulant therapy in patients with atrial flutter/AF for most procedures with a very low risk of bleeding, including cardiac device implantation (pacemaker or implantable defibrillator). (D)
- Interrupt anticoagulant therapy in patients with atrial flutter/AF for most procedures with an intermediate or high risk of major bleeding. (B)
- Consider beginning interruption 5-7 days before the procedure when a decision to interrupt aspirin or clopidogrel therapy for an invasive procedure has been made in patients with atrial flutter/AF. Consider beginning interruption 7-10 days before the procedure for procedures with a very high risk of bleeding. (C)
- Consider beginning interruption 5 days before the procedure when a decision to interrupt warfarin therapy for an invasive procedure has been made in patients with atrial flutter/AF. Consider performing procedures with low bleeding risk when the INR is < 1.5, and performing procedures with intermediate or high bleeding risk when the INR is < 1.2. (C)
- Consider beginning interruption 1-2 days before a procedure with a low risk of major bleeding and 2-3 days before a procedure with an intermediate or high risk of major bleeding when a decision to interrupt apixaban or rivaroxaban therapy for an invasive procedure has been made in patients with atrial flutter/AF. (C)
- Consider beginning interruption 1-2 days before a procedure with a low risk of major bleeding and 2-3 days before a procedure with an intermediate or high risk of major bleeding when a decision to interrupt dabigatran therapy for an invasive procedure has been made in patients with atrial flutter/AF and an eGFR ≥ 80 mL/min/1.73 m². Use the upper end of these ranges if the eGFR is 50-80 mL/min/1.73 m², add an additional day when the eGFR is 30-50 mL/min/1.73 m², and add yet one more day of dabigatran withdrawal if the eGFR is < 30 mL/min/1.73 m². (C)

### Patients with AF, preprocedural bridging
As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2019 guidelines:
- Bridge with UFH or LMWH in patients with AF and a mechanical heart valve undergoing procedures requiring interruption of warfarin. Recognize that decisions on bridging therapy should balance the risks of stroke and bleeding. (B)
- Recognize that decisions about bridging therapy (UFH or LMWH) in patients with AF without mechanical heart valves requiring interruption of warfarin for procedures should balance the risks of stroke and bleeding and the duration of time the patient will not be anticoagulated. (B)

As per CSANZ/NHFA 2018 guidelines:
- Avoid bridging with LMWH or UFH in patients treated with warfarin, at low-to-moderate risk of stroke undergoing planned surgical intervention. (D)
- Avoid bridging with LMWH or UFH in patients treated with NOACs. (D)
- Bridge with LMWH or UFH in patients at very high risk of stroke (such as warfarin-treated patients with mitral mechanical prosthetic heart valves) undergoing planned surgical intervention. (B)

As per CCS 2014 guidelines:
- Consider bridging with LMWH or UFH when the INR is below the therapeutic INR target when a decision to interrupt warfarin therapy for an invasive procedure has been made in patients with atrial flutter/AF at high risk of thromboembolic events (CHADS2 score ≥ 3, mechanical heart valve, stroke or TIA within 3 months, rheumatic heart disease). (C)
- Bridge with LMWH or UFH bridging before an invasive procedure when the INR is < 2.0, and discontinue bridging 24 hours before the procedure for LMWH and 4-6 hours before the procedure for UFH. (B)
- Consider restarting LMWH or UFH (when used as bridging for an invasive procedure after the procedure) when hemostasis is established (usually 24 hours for a procedure with a low risk of bleeding and 48-72 hours for a procedure with an intermediate or high risk of bleeding) in prophylactic dosages for the first 24-72 hours and then increased to therapeutic dosages. Continue bridging until an OAC is therapeutic. (C)

### Patients with AF, postprocedural resumption
As per CCS 2014 guidelines:
- Consider restarting therapy once hemostasis is established when warfarin, acetylsalicylic acid, or clopidogrel have been withdrawn for an invasive procedure (usually 24-48 hours for procedures at low risk of bleeding). (C)
- Consider restarting therapy after the procedure 1 day after hemostasis is established when apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban have been withdrawn for an invasive procedure. (C)

## Patient education

### General counseling
As per BSG/ESGE 2021 guidelines:
- Counsel all patients on antiplatelets or anticoagulants about the increased risk of postprocedural hemorrhage. (B)
- Counsel all patients on the thrombotic risks of discontinuing antiplatelets or anticoagulants, as well as the hemorrhagic risks of continuing therapy. (B)
