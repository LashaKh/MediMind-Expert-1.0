# ST-elevation myocardial infarction



## Guidelines

### Key sources
The following summarized guidelines for the evaluation and management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction are prepared by our editorial team based on guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP 2025), the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI/NAEMSP/AHA/ACC/ACEP 2025), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP 2024), the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS/CAIC 2024), the European Society of Cardiology (ESC/EACTS 2024), the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT/SVM/SCMR/SCA/AHA/ASNC/HRS/ACC/ACS 2024), the European Society of Cardiology (ESC 2023,2018), the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI/AHA/ACC 2022), the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF 2022), the American Heart Association (AHA 2020), the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM 2020), and the American Heart Association 
(AHA/ACC 2013).

## What's new

The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) have released updated guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Dual antiplatelet therapy is recommended for at least 12 months in patients with ACS not at high bleeding risk, with ticagrelor or prasugrel preferred over clopidogrel in those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). High-intensity statin therapy is recommended for all patients with ACS. For STEMI, primary PCI is recommended, with fibrinolytic therapy offered within 12 hours when the anticipated delay to primary PCI exceeds 120 minutes. Rescue PCI is recommended after failed fibrinolytic therapy. For procedural Considerations, the radial approach is recommended over the femoral approach, intracoronary imaging is recommended during PCI for complex lesions, and routine manual aspiration thrombectomy should be avoided. Non-infarct-related artery PCI after the index procedure is recommended over a staged approach in selected stable patients with multivessel disease.

## Follow-up and Surveillance

### Cardiac Rehabilitation
As per ACC/ACEP/AHA/…/SCAI 2025 guidelines:
- Refer patients with ACS to an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program prior to hospital discharge to reduce death, myocardial infarction, hospital readmissions, and improve functional status and QoL. (A)
- Consider offering a home-based cardiac rehabilitation program as a reasonable alternative to a center-based program in patients with ACS to improve functional status and QoL. (C)

As per AAFP 2024 guidelines, offer cardiac rehabilitation to reduce mortality in patients with recent myocardial infarction. (B)

#### Landmark Trials: HYCARET Study - PubMed Link Required
In adults who had a cardiovascular event or procedure, no contraindications to exercise, and access to a mobile telephone, hybrid cardiac rehabilitation was noninferior to standard cardiac rehabilitation with respect to cardiovascular events or death by the end of follow-up.
*Pamela Seron et al. JAMA Netw Open. 2024 Jan 2.*

As per ESC 2023 guidelines:
- Offer a medically supervised, structured, comprehensive, multidisciplinary exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation and prevention program in all patients with ACS. (A)
- Consider prescribing a polypill as an option to improve adherence and outcomes in secondary prevention after ACS. (C)

As per ACC/AHA/SCAI 2022 guidelines:
- Offer a comprehensive home-based or center-based cardiac rehabilitation program either before hospital discharge or during the first outpatient visit in patients treated with revascularization to reduce deaths and hospital readmissions and improve QoL. (A)
- Educate patients treated with revascularization about CVD risk factors and their modification to reduce cardiovascular events. (B)

### Lipid Monitoring
As per ACC/ACEP/AHA/…/SCAI 2025 guidelines, Obtain a fasting lipid panel 4-8 weeks after initiation or dose adjustment of lipid-lowering therapy in patients after ACS to assess response or adherence to therapy. (B)

### Follow-up Imaging
As per ESC 2023 guidelines:
- Re-evaluate LVEF 6-12 weeks after ACS (and after complete revascularization and the institution of optimal medical therapy) to assess the potential need for SCD primary prevention ICD implantation in patients with pre-discharge LVEF ≤ 40%. (B)
- Consider Obtaining cardiac MRI as an adjunctive imaging modality to assess the potential need for primary prevention ICD implantation. (C)

### Management of Post-STEMI Pericarditis
As per ACC/AHA 2013 guidelines:
- Administer aspirin for patients with pericarditis following STEMI. (B)
- Consider acetaminophen, colchicine, or narcotic analgesics if aspirin, even in higher doses, is not effective. (C)
- Avoid corticosteroids and NSAIDs as they are potentially harmful for treatment of pericarditis after STEMI. (D)

## Quality Improvement

### Healthcare System and Hospital Requirements - Pre-hospital Settings
As per ACC/ACEP/AHA/…/SCAI 2025 guidelines, ensure that all communities create and maintain regional systems of STEMI care that coordinate prehospital and hospital-based care processes to reduce total ischemic time and improve survival in patients with STEMI. (B)

As per ESC 2023 guidelines, ensure that:
- Pre-hospital management of patients with a working diagnosis of STEMI is based on regional networks designed to deliver reperfusion therapy expeditiously and effectively, with efforts made to make primary PCI available to as many patients as possible. (B)
- Patients transferred for primary PCI bypassing the emergency department and coronary care unit/ICU and are transferred directly to the catheterization laboratory. (B)
- Emergency medical services transfer patients with suspected STEMI to a PCI-capable center bypassing non-PCI centers. (B)
- Strategies are in place to facilitate the transfer of all patients with suspected ACS after resuscitated cardiac arrest directly to a hospital offering 24/7 primary PCI via one specialized emergency medical service. (B)
- Ambulance teams are trained and equipped to identify ECG patterns suggestive of acute coronary occlusion and to administer initial therapy, including defibrillation and fibrinolysis when applicable. (B)
- All emergency medical services participating in the care of patients with suspected STEMI record and audit delay times and work together to achieve and maintain quality targets. (B)

### Healthcare System and Hospital Requirements - Hospital Settings
As per ESC 2023 guidelines, ensure that:
- Primary PCI-capable centers deliver a 24/7 service and are able to Perform primary PCI without delay. (B)
- All hospitals participating in the care of high-risk patients have an intensive cardiac care unit/coronary care unit equipped to provide all required aspects of care, including treatment of ischemia, severe HF, arrhythmias, and common comorbidities. (B)
- All hospitals participating in the care of patients with suspected STEMI record and audit delay times and work together to achieve and maintain quality targets. (B)

As per ACC/AHA/SCAI 2022 guidelines:
- Ensure that cardiac surgery and PCI programs participate in state, regional, or national clinical data registries and receive periodic reports of their risk-adjusted outcomes as a quality assessment and improvement strategy with the goal of improving patient outcomes. (B)
- Ensure that cardiac surgery and PCI programs have a quality improvement program routinely Performing the following with the goal of improving patient outcomes: review of institutional quality programs and outcomes, review of individual operator outcomes, peer review of difficult or complicated cases, random case reviews. (B)
- Consider affiliating smaller-volume cardiac surgery and PCI programs with a high-volume center to improve patient care. (C)
