# Digoxin Toxicity

## Guidelines

### Key Sources
The following summarized guidelines for the management of digoxin toxicity are prepared by our editorial team based on guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA 2023), the American Heart Association (AHA/HRS/ACC 2019), and the Extracorporeal Treatments in Poisoning Workgroup (EXTRIP 2016).

## Clinical Findings

### Patient Demographics
- Elderly age - Increased risk due to decreased renal function and drug clearance

### Vital Signs
- Bradycardia - Slow heart rate due to enhanced vagal tone and AV conduction blocks
- Tachycardia - Ventricular arrhythmias due to enhanced automaticity

### Symptoms
- Abdominal pain - Gastrointestinal manifestation of toxicity
- Dizziness - Due to hemodynamic compromise from arrhythmias
- Dyspnea - Shortness of breath from cardiac dysfunction
- Loss of appetite - Common gastrointestinal symptom
- Nausea - Early sign of digoxin toxicity
- Palpitations - Awareness of irregular or rapid heartbeat
- Visual disturbances - Classic neurological sign including yellow-green vision
- Vomiting - Gastrointestinal manifestation

## Studies

### 2023 • NICO Study
In comatose patients with suspected acute poisoning and a GCS score < 9, restricted intubation was superior to routine practice with respect to median length of mechanical ventilation.

## Medical Management

### Digoxin Immune Fab

**As per AHA 2023 guidelines:**
- Administer digoxin immune Fab in patients with digoxin or digitoxin poisoning. (B)
- Consider administering digoxin immune Fab in patients with yellow oleander poisoning. (C)
- Consider administering digoxin immune Fab in patients with poisoning from cardiac glycosides other than digoxin, digitoxin, and yellow oleander. (C)

**As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2019 guidelines:**
- Consider administering digoxin immune fAb to increase HR and improve symptoms in patients with bradycardia associated with symptoms or hemodynamic compromise in the setting of digoxin toxicity. (C)

### Management of Arrhythmias

**As per AHA 2023 guidelines:**
- Consider administering atropine for the management of bradyarrhythmias in patients with digoxin or other cardiac glycoside poisoning. (C)
- Consider administering lidocaine, phenytoin, or bretylium for the management of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with digitalis or other cardiac glycoside poisoning until digoxin immune Fab can be administered. (C)

### Therapeutic Procedures

#### Temporary Cardiac Pacing
**As per AHA 2023 guidelines:**
- Consider attempting electrical pacing for the management of bradyarrhythmias in patients with digoxin or other cardiac glycoside poisoning. (C)

#### Extracorporeal Treatment (ECTR)

**As per AHA 2023 guidelines:**
- Do not perform hemodialysis, hemofiltration, hemoperfusion, or plasmapheresis in patients with digoxin poisoning. (D)

**As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2019 guidelines:**
- Do not offer hemodialysis for removal of digoxin in patients with bradycardia associated with symptoms or hemodynamic compromise attributable to digoxin toxicity.** (D)

**As per EXTRIP 2016 guidelines:**

**Do not offer ECTR in any of the following situations:** (D)
- Severe digoxin toxicity regardless if Fab is administered
- Suspected digoxin ingestion regardless if Fab is administered
- Elevated digoxin serum concentrations regardless if Fab is administered
- Cardiovascular disturbances if Fab is administered
- Serum potassium > 6.0 mmol/L

**Avoid offering ECTR in patients with severe digoxin toxicity regardless if Fab is not administered.** (D)

**Avoid offering ECTR for removing digoxin immune Fab complex in patients with no clinical toxicity and impaired kidney function in any of the following situations:** (D)
- Cardiovascular disturbance if Fab is not administered
- Serum potassium level of 6.0-7.0 mEq/L

**Insufficient evidence to recommend for or against ECTR for removing digoxin immune Fab complex in patients with clinical toxicity and impaired kidney function in case of serum potassium levels > 7.0 mmol/L.** (I)

**Do not offer intermittent hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, or other ECTR modalities in patients with severe digoxin poisoning.** (D)

**Do not offer therapeutic plasma exchange for removing digoxin immune Fab complex in patients with impaired kidney function.** (D)

### Specific Circumstances

#### Patients with Toad Venom Poisoning
**As per AHA 2023 guidelines:**
- **Consider administering digoxin immune fAb in patients with Bufo toad venom poisoning.** (C)
