# Beta-blocker Toxicity

## Background

### Overview

#### **Definition**
Beta-blocker toxicity refers to an overdose or excessive exposure to β-blocker medications.

#### **Pathophysiology**
The pathophysiology of β-blocker toxicity involves the excessive blockade of β-adrenergic receptors. This blockade leads to a decrease in HR and myocardial workload.

#### **Epidemiology**
The incidence of β-blocker toxicity is estimated at 5.1% among hospitalized patients with acute poisoning.

#### **Disease Course**
Clinically, patients with β-blocker toxicity often present with bradycardia, hypotension, and varying degrees of AV block. In severe cases, patients may experience life-threatening cardiogenic shock refractory to pharmacological interventions.

#### **Prognosis and Risk of Recurrence**
The prognosis of β-blocker toxicity can range from mild to severe toxicity, depending on the amount of β-blocker ingested and the time elapsed before treatment.


## Guidelines

### Key Sources
The following summarized guidelines for the evaluation and management of beta-blocker toxicity are prepared by our editorial team based on guidelines from:
- American Heart Association (AHA 2023)
- American Heart Association (AHA/HRS/ACC 2019)
- American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC/AACT/ACMT 2005)

## Clinical Findings

### Symptoms
- Seizure

### Vital Signs
- Bradycardia
- Hypotension

### Medication History
- β-blockers

---

## Studies

### 2023 • NICO
In comatose patients with suspected acute poisoning and a GCS score < 9, restricted intubation was superior to routine practice with respect to median length of mechanical ventilation.

## Diagnostic Investigations

### Initial Assessment
As per AACT/AAPCC/ACMT 2005 guidelines, Elicit history to determine the precise ingested dose of a β-blocker, the presence of coingestants and comorbidities in patients without evidence of self-harm. (B)


## Medical Management

### Admission to Emergency Department

As per AACT/AAPCC/ACMT 2005 guidelines:
Refer patients with stated or suspected self-harm or victims of a potentially malicious administration of β-blocker to an emergency department immediately, guided by local poison center procedures, regardless of the dose reported. (B)

Consider referring patients without evidence of self-harm to an emergency department if ingested:
- An amount exceeding the usual maximum single therapeutic dose
- An amount equal to or greater than the lowest reported toxic dose
- Any excess dose of any β-blocker in combination with a CCB
- Any excess dose of any β-blocker in the presence of a serious underlying CVD (such as end-stage cardiomyopathy) (C) 


Refer asymptomatic patients ingested a β-blocker exceeding the referral dose to an emergency department if the ingestion occurred within the following timeframes of contacting the poison center:
- 6 hours for an immediate-release product other than sotalol
- 8 hours for a sustained-release product
- 12 hours for sotalol (B)

Offer ambulance transportation for patients referred to emergency departments because of the potential for life-threatening complications of β-blocker overdose. Provide usual supportive care en route to the hospital, including IV fluids for hypotension. (B)

### Gastric Decontamination
As per AACT/AAPCC/ACMT 2005 guidelines:
- Do not induce emesis in patients who have ingested a β-blocker exceeding the referral dose. (D)

- Consider administering oral activated charcoal, if available and not contraindicated, but not delaying transportation. (B)

### High-dose Insulin
As per AHA 2023 guidelines, Administer high-dose insulin for the management of hypotension in patients with β-blocker toxicity refractory to or in conjunction with vasopressor therapy. (B)

As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2019 guidelines, Consider administering high-dose insulin to increase HR and improve symptoms in patients with bradycardia associated with symptoms or hemodynamic compromise because of β-blocker overdose. (C)

### Glucagon
As per AHA 2023 guidelines, Consider administering a bolus of glucagon, followed by continuous infusion, for the management of bradycardia or hypotension in patients with β-blocker toxicity. (C) 

As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2019 guidelines, Consider administering glucagon to increase HR and improve symptoms in patients with bradycardia associated with symptoms or hemodynamic compromise because of β-blocker overdose. (C) 

### Vasopressors
As per AHA 2023 guidelines, Administer vasopressors for the management of hypotension in patients with β-blocker toxicity. (B)

### Atropine
As per AHA 2023 guidelines, Consider administering atropine for the management of β-blocker-induced bradycardia. (C)

### Lipid Emulsion Therapy
As per AHA 2023 guidelines, insufficient evidence to support the use of IV lipid emulsion therapy in patients with life-threatening β-blocker toxicity. (I) 



## Inpatient Care

### Inpatient Monitoring
As per AACT/AAPCC/ACMT 2005 guidelines:
Monitor asymptomatic patients referred to healthcare facilities for the following durations after ingestion:
- 6 hours for an immediate-release product other than sotalol
- 8 hours for a sustained-release product
- 12 hours for sotalol (B)

Do not obtain routine 24-hour inpatient monitoring in asymptomatic patients who have unintentionally ingested a sustained-release product. (D)


## Therapeutic Procedures

### Temporary Cardiac Pacing
As per AHA 2023 guidelines, consider attempting electrical pacing in patients with β-blocker-induced bradycardia. (C)

### Hemodialysis

As per AHA 2023 guidelines, consider performing hemodialysis in patients with life-threatening atenolol or sotalol toxicity. (C)

### ECMO
As per AHA 2023 guidelines, consider initiating extracorporeal life support, such as venoarterial ECMO, in patients with life-threatening β-blocker toxicity with cardiogenic shock refractory to pharmacological interventions. (C)


## Follow-up and Surveillance

### Outcome Assessment
As per AACT/AAPCC/ACMT 2005 guidelines, obtain follow-up calls depending on the specific circumstances to determine outcome at appropriate intervals for up to 12-24 hours based on the judgment of the poison center staff. (B)
