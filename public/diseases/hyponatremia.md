# Hyponatremia – Pathway


## Background

### Overview

#### **Definition**
Hyponatremia an electrolyte disorder characterized by low serum sodium concentration, and is typically defined as a serum sodium of < 135 mEq/L.

#### **Pathophysiology**
Causes of hyponatremia include increased water intake (psychogenic polydipsia) , low dietary solute intake (tea and toast diet) , decreased water excretion secondary to elevated plasma ADH levels (volume depletion, SIADH, severe hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency) , and expansion of plasma volume in the context of edematous states.

#### **Epidemiology**
The prevalence of hyponatremia in the general population of the US is 1.72%.

#### **Disease course**
Treatment of hyponatremia requires careful attention to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, which can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome, permanent neurological impairment, and death.

#### **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**
Approximately 40% of patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome recover fully, whereas 25% have persistent neurological deficits. Mortality associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome is approximately 6%.

Seon Ha Baek et al. JAMA Intern Med. 2021 Jan 1.

## Classification and risk stratification

### Classification 
As per ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines, Classify hyponatremia based on the documented duration:

| Situation | Guidance |
|-----------|----------|
| Acute | < 48 hours |
| Chronic | ≥ 48 hours |
| Chronic (presumably)  | If it cannot be classified unless there is clinical or anamnestic evidence of the contrary |

### Severity grading, based on sodium concentration: 
As per ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines, classify hyponatremia based on the serum sodium concentration:

| Situation | Guidance |
|-----------|----------|
| Mild | 130-135 mmol/L |
| Moderate | 125-129 mmol/L |
| Profound | < 125 mmol/L |

### Severity grading, based on symptoms: 
As per ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines, Classify hyponatremia based on the symptomatic presentation:
- **Moderate:** any biochemical degree of hyponatremia in the presence of moderate symptoms (nausea without vomiting, confusion, or headache) 
- **Severe:** any biochemical degree of hyponatremia in the presence of severe symptoms (vomiting, altered level of consciousness, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress) .

### Risk of osmotic demyelination: 
As per ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines, recognize that the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome depends on the following factors:
- Biochemical degree and duration of hyponatremia at presentation
- Speed of increase in serum sodium concentration
- History of alcohol abuse and/or liver disease
- Use of thiazide or antidepressant medications.

## Diagnostic investigations

### Urine sodium
As per ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines:

(B) Measure urine sodium concentration on a spot urine sample (obtained and interpreted with concomitant serum sodium concentration)  in patients with urine osmolality > 100 mOsm/kg.

(C) Consider attributing hyponatremia to low effective arterial volume in patients with a urine sodium concentration ≤ 30 mmol/L.

(C) Consider assessing the extracellular fluid status and use of diuretics to further differentiate likely causes of hyponatremia in patients with urine sodium concentration > 30 mmol/L.

### Urine osmolality
As per ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines:

(B) Obtain and interpret urine osmolality on a spot urine sample as the initial step in the evaluation of patients with hypotonic hyponatremia.

(B) Attribute hyponatremia to relative excess water intake in patients with a urine osmolality ≤ 100 mOsm/kg.

### Serum osmolality
As per ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines:

View hyponatremia as hypotonic hyponatremia in the absence of causes of non-hypotonic hyponatremia, such as:
- Effective osmoles raising serum osmolality causing hyponatremia: isotonic or hypertonic glucose, mannitol, glycine, histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate, hyperosmolar radiocontrast media, maltose
- Presence of endogenous solutes causing pseudohyponatremia (laboratory artifact) : triglycerides, cholesterol, protein, IVIG, monoclonal gammopathies

Recognize that hyponatremia with a measured serum osmolality < 275 mOsm/kg reflects hypotonic hyponatremia. (B) 


As per ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines, 
**Serum glucose:** 
measure serum glucose concentration to exclude hyperglycemic hyponatremia, and correct the measured serum sodium concentration for the serum glucose concentration if the latter is increased. (B) 


As per KSEBPR/KSN 2022 guidelines, 
**Fractional urinary excretion of uric acid:**
consider obtaining an additional measurement of fractional urinary excretion of uric acid in patients with hyponatremia to differentiate likely causes of hyponatremia, such as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis or diuretic-induced hyponatremia. (E) 


As per KSEBPR/KSN 2022 guidelines, 
**Copeptin-to-urinary sodium ratio:**
insufficient evidence to recommend obtaining copeptin-to-urinary sodium ratio to assess patient volume status.(I) 


As per ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines, 
**Vasopressin levels:** 
avoid measuring vasopressin as part of the diagnostic evaluation for the SIADH. (D) 

## Medical management

### Management of mildly symptomatic patients, acute setting:

**As per KSEBPR/KSN 2022 guidelines:**
Obtain rigorous evaluation for the causes of mild hyponatremia and manage causative diseases to improve clinical outcomes. (E) 

**As per ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines:**

- Ensure that the serum sodium concentration has been measured using the same technique used for the previous measurement and that no administrative errors in sample handling have occurred.
- Discontinue non-essential fluids, medications, and other factors likely to contribute to or provoke hyponatremia.
(B) Initiate treatment directed at the underlying cause of hyponatremia.
(C) Consider administering a single infusion of 3% hypertonic saline (150 mL IV, over 20 minutes)  if the acute decrease in serum sodium concentration is > 10 mmol/L.
(C) Consider obtaining a follow-up serum sodium concentration after 4 hours, using the same technique as used for the previous measurement.

### Management of mildly symptomatic patients, chronic setting
**As per ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines:**
- Discontinue non-essential fluids, medications, and other factors likely to contribute to or provoke hyponatremia.
(B) Initiate treatment directed at the underlying cause of hyponatremia.
(D) rapeutic measures aimed solely at increasing the serum sodium concentration in patients with mild hyponatremia.
(D)  sodium concentration of > 10 mmol/L during the first 24 hours, or > 8 mmol/L during every subsequent 24-hour period in patients with moderate or profound hyponatremia.
(C) Consider measuring serum sodium concentration every 6 hours until the serum sodium concentration has stabilized in patients with moderate or profound hyponatremia.

### Management of moderately symptomatic patients
**As per ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines:**
(B) Obtain prompt diagnostic assessment in moderately symptomatic patients with hyponatremia.
- Discontinue fluids, medications, and other factors likely to contribute to or provoke hyponatremia, if possible.
(B) Initiate treatment directed at the underlying cause of hyponatremia.
(C) Consider administering a single infusion of 3% hypertonic saline (150 mL IV, over 20 minutes)  immediately.

(C) Consider targeting a 5 mmol/L increase in serum sodium concentration per 24-hour period.
(C) Consider limiting the increase in serum sodium concentration to 10 mmol/L in the first 24 hours and 8 mmol/L during every 24 hours thereafter, until a serum sodium concentration of 130 mmol/L is reached.
(C) Consider obtaining additional diagnostic evaluation for other causes of the symptoms if the symptoms do not improve with an increase in serum sodium concentration.
(C) Consider managing patients as in severely symptomatic hyponatremia if the serum sodium concentration further decreases despite treating the underlying diagnosis.

### Management of severely symptomatic patients, initial management:
**As per AAFP 2023 guidelines:**
- Consider administering bolus or continuous infusions of 3% hypertonic saline in patients with a sodium concentration of < 125 mEq/L and moderate or severe symptoms. Recognize that bolus infusion improves sodium concentration more quickly with less overcorrection. (C) 
(B) Monitor sodium concentration after each hypertonic saline bolus and every 6 hours during the first 24 hours of treatment in patients with severe symptomatic hyponatremia.
(B) Limit sodium correction to 8 mEq/L over 24 hours in patients with chronic hyponatremia at increased risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. Limit sodium correction to 12 mEq/L over 24 hours and 18 mEq/L over 48 hours in patients without risk factors to minimize the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome.

**As per KSEBPR/KSN 2022 guidelines:**
(C) Consider administering rapid intermittent boluses of hypertonic saline in patients with symptomatic severe hypotonic hyponatremia.

**As per ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines:**
(B) Administer IV infusion of 3% hypertonic saline (150 mL IV, over 20 minutes)  promptly in patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.
(B) Obtain a follow-up serum sodium concentration 20 minutes after the initial infusion, while administering a second infusion of 150 mL 3% hypertonic saline over the subsequent 20 minutes.
(C) Consider repeating therapeutic recommendations twice or until a target of 5 mmol/L increase in serum sodium concentration is achieved.
- Manage patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia in an environment where close biochemical and clinical monitoring can be provided.

#### Updated evidence: SALSA
In adults patients with moderately severe-to-severe hyponatremia and glucose-corrected serum sodium levels ≤ 125 mmol/L, rapid intermittent bolus was not superior to slow continuous infusion with respect to incidence of overcorrection.

Seon Ha Baek et al. JAMA Intern Med. 2021 Jan 1.

### Management of severely symptomatic patients, adequate response to initial management:
**As per AAFP 2023 guidelines:**
(B) Decide on the next steps of the management of hypotonic hyponatremia (true hyponatremia)  in the absence of severe hyponatremia based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic.

**As per ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines:**
(B) Discontinue hypertonic saline infusion in patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia displaying an adequate response to initial management.
(B) Maintain IV access open by infusing the smallest feasible volume of 0.9% saline until cause-specific treatment is started.
(B) Initiate cause-specific treatment, if available, aiming at least to stabilize sodium concentration.
(B) Limit the increase in serum sodium concentration to a total of 10 mmol/L during the first 24 hours and an additional 8 mmol/L during every 24 hours thereafter until the serum sodium concentration reaches 130 mmol/L.
(C) Consider measuring sodium concentration after 6 and 12 hours, and daily afterward until the serum sodium concentration has stabilized.

### Management of severely symptomatic patients, inadequate response to initial management
**As per ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines:**
(B) Continue IV infusion of 3% hypertonic saline in patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia displaying an inadequate response to initial treatment, aiming for an additional increase in serum sodium concentration by 1 mmol/L per hour.
(B) Discontinue IV infusion of 3% hypertonic saline when symptoms improve, the serum sodium concentration increases by ≥ 10 mmol/L in total, or the serum sodium concentration reaches 130 mmol/L, whichever occurs first.
(C) Consider measuring serum sodium concentration every 4 hours as long as an IV infusion of 3% hypertonic saline is continued.

### Management of overly rapid correction:
**As per KSEBPR/KSN 2022 guidelines:**
(C) Consider administering desmopressin individually according to risk factors affecting overcorrection, hypertonic saline therapeutic regimen, and whether to administer dextrose solution during overcorrection in patients with hyponatremia.

**As per ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines:**
(B) Discontinue any ongoing treatments aimed at raising serum sodium in patients with overly rapid correction.
(B) Intervene promptly to re-lower the serum sodium concentration if it increases > 10 mmol/L during the first 24 hours or > 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period thereafter.
(C) Consider administering an infusion of 10 mL/kg body weight of electrolyte-free water (such as glucose solutions)  over 1 hour, in consultation with an expert and under strict monitoring of urine output and fluid balance.
(C) Consider adding IV desmopressin (2 mcg, repeated not more frequently than every 8 hours) , after consultation with an expert.

## Specific circumstances

### Patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia
**As per ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines:**
(A)  IV infusion of a crystalloid solution (0.9% saline or a balanced crystalloid, 0.5-1.0 mL/kg/hour)  to restore extracellular volume in patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia.
- Manage patients with hemodynamic instability in an environment where close biochemical and clinical monitoring can be provided.
- Prioritize rapid fluid resuscitation over concerns regarding an overly rapid rise in serum sodium concentration in patients with hemodynamic instability.

### Patients with hypervolemic hyponatremia
**As per ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines:**
(D) peutic measures aimed solely at increasing the serum sodium concentration in patients with mild or moderate hyponatremia.
(C) Consider restricting fluid administration to prevent further fluid overload.
(D)  receptor antagonists and demeclocycline in patients with hypervolemic hyponatremia.

### Patients with SIADH:

### Diagnostic criteria for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion

*Calculator Available*

The Diagnostic Criteria for Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH)  is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of SIADH, a condition characterized by excessive release of antidiuretic hormone from the posterior pituitary gland or other sources. The criteria are primarily used to identify patients with hyponatremia, a common electrolyte disorder, who may have SIADH as the underlying cause.

**Essential criteria (all must be met = 8 points) :**
- Effective serum osmolality < 275 mOsm/kg
- Urine osmolality > 100 mOsm/kg
- No clinical evidence of hypovolemia or hypervolemia
- Urine sodium concentration > 30 mmol/L with normal dietary salt and water intake
- Absence of adrenal, thyroid, pituitary or renal insufficiency
- No recent use of diuretic agents

**Supplemental criteria (each = 1 point) :**
- Serum uric acid < 0.24 mmol/L [< 4 mg/dL]
- Serum urea < 3.6 mmol/L [< 21.6 mg/dL]
- Failure to correct hyponatremia after 0.9% saline infusion
- Fractional sodium excretion > 0.5%
- Fractional urea excretion > 55%
- Fractional uric acid excretion > 12%
- Correction of hyponatremia through fluid restriction

**Scoring interpretation:**
- ≥8 points: Meets criteria for possible SIADH
- <8 points: Criteria not met

### Patients with exercise-associated hyponatremia, prevention
**As per WMS 2020 guidelines:**
(A) oiding sustained overhydration during exercise, as it is the primary risk factor for development of all variants of exercise-associated hyponatremia.
(B) Educate participants and medical professionals about proper hydration strategies for exertional activities.
(A) rticipants of endurance athletic events or strenuous wilderness activities: avoiding overdrinking during the activity
(B) Drinking according to thirst, or determining an estimation of their individual fluid needs during pre-event training activities by assessing body weight losses per hour, which limits the potential for weight gain
(B) Advise ensuring freely available sodium and/or salty snacks for consumption along with the appropriate fluid intake, particularly in long, hot events in non-heat acclimatized persons, but recognize that this strategy will not prevent exercise-associated hyponatremia when combined with overdrinking.

### Patients with exercise-associated hyponatremia, assessment: 
**As per WMS 2020 guidelines:**
(B) Obtain point-of-care testing in at-risk symptomatic patients when available. Integrate all available clinical and historical information into an assessment of the patient's hydration status (history of fluid intake, food intake, presenting signs and symptoms, body weight if available, and urine output) , if testing is unavailable.

### Patients with exercise-associated hyponatremia, outpatient management
**As per WMS 2020 guidelines:**
(B) Advise restricting oral fluids if exercise-associated hyponatremia from fluid overload is associated with mild symptoms. Do not administer hypotonic fluids in patients with suspected exercise-associated hyponatremia.
(C) Consider adding oral sodium in hypertonic solutions or advising foods with high sodium content (salty snacks)  for increasing serum sodium levels and enhancing symptom relief (over fluid restriction)  in patients with mild exercise-associated hyponatremia, if tolerated.

### Patients with exercise-associated hyponatremia, inpatient management
**As per WMS 2020 guidelines:**
- (B)Inform receiving caregivers about the potential diagnosis of exercise-associated hyponatremia and appropriate fluid management (withhold hypotonic fluids) when transferring care.
- (D)Avoid administering oral and IV hypotonic or isotonic fluids early in the management of patients with exercise-associated hyponatremia, although, consider using in certain clinical contexts once sodium correction has been initiated or hypovolemia is confirmed.
- (D)Do not administer IV hypotonic fluids in patients with suspected fluid overload exercise-associated hyponatremia.
- (B)Restrict isotonic fluid intake in patients with known or suspected severe hypervolemic exercise-associated hyponatremia until urination begins.
- (A)Obtain sodium estimation as rapidly as possible after hospital arrival of patients with suspected exercise-associated hyponatremia, particularly in patients with altered mental status.
- (A)Obtain rapid assessment for signs and symptoms of cerebral edema or non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema in all patients with possible exercise-associated hyponatremia.
- (B)Administer an immediate 100 mL bolus of IV hypertonic saline if signs and symptoms of encephalopathy (with or without non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema) develop and severe exercise-associated hyponatremia is strongly suspected.
- (A)Administer a 100 mL bolus of IV hypertonic saline in patients with biochemically confirmed severe exercise-associated hyponatremia or symptomatic exercise-associated hyponatremia. Consider administering repeated boluses twice at 10-min intervals (3 doses in total) or until improvement of neurologic symptoms, with the aim of acutely increasing serum sodium concentration by about 4 to 5 mmol/L and reversing cerebral edema.

### Patients with exercise-associated hyponatremia, observation: 
**As per WMS 2020 guidelines:**
(B) Observe patients for at least 60 minutes after exercise to ensure no decompensation from delayed symptomatic exercise-associated hyponatremia occurs after cessation of exercise.

### Patients with HF: 
**As per KSEBPR/KSN 2022 guidelines:**
(C) Consider administering vaptans in patients with HF and hypervolemic hyponatremia in terms of rapid sodium correction.

### Patients with liver disease:

**As per KSEBPR/KSN 2022 guidelines:**
(I) Insufficient evidence to support the use of vaptans in patients with liver cirrhosis and hypervolemic hyponatremia.

**As per AASLD 2021 guidelines:**
(E) Obtain monitoring and advise water restriction in patients with mild hyponatremia (126-135 mEq/L)  without symptoms.
(E) Advise water restriction to < 1,000 mL/day and discontinue diuretics for the management of patients with moderate hyponatremia (120-125 mEq/L) .
(E) Advise more severe water restriction and administer albumin infusion for the management of patients with severe hyponatremia (< 120 mEq/L) .
(E) Administer vasopressin receptor antagonists with caution and only for a short term (≤ 30 days)  in patients with cirrhosis, because these agents can raise serum sodium during treatment.
(E) Reserve hypertonic saline for short-term treatment of patients with symptomatic or severe hyponatremia or with imminent liver transplantation.
(E) Set the goal rate of increase of serum sodium of 4-6 mEq/L per 24-hour period (not exceeding 8 mEq/L per 24-hour period)  to ameliorate the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome when correction of chronic hyponatremia is indicated in patients with cirrhosis.
(E) Recognize that severe hyponatremia (< 120 mEq/L)  at the time of liver transplantation increases the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome with liver transplantation. Consider ensuring multidisciplinary coordinated care to mitigate the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome.

**As per EASL 2018 guidelines:**
(B) Recognize that the development of hyponatremia (serum sodium concentration < 130 mmol/L)  in patients with cirrhosis carries an ominous prognosis, as it is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Evaluate patients with hyponatremia for liver transplantation.
(B) Remove the cause and administer normal saline for the management of hypovolemic hyponatremia.
(B) Advise fluid restriction to 1,000 mL/day in the management of hypervolemic hyponatremia since it may prevent a further reduction in serum sodium levels.
(B) Limit the use of hypertonic saline in the management of hypervolemic hyponatremia to the rare cases presenting with life-threatening complications. Consider administering hypertonic saline in patients with severe hyponatremia expected to get liver transplantation within a few days. Correct the serum sodium concentration slowly (≤ 8 mmol/L per day) , once an attenuation of symptoms has been obtained, to avoid irreversible neurological sequelae, such as osmotic demyelination.
(C) Consider administering albumin in patients with hypervolemic hyponatremia.
(D) side clinical trials.

### Patients with cerebral disease:

**As per AHA/ASA 2023 guidelines:**
(C) Consider administering mineralocorticoids for the treatment of natriuresis and hyponatremia in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

**As per KSEBPR/KSN 2022 guidelines:**
(E) Individualize administration of hypertonic or isotonic saline infusion, oral sodium chloride, or fludrocortisone for the correction of hypoosmolar hyponatremia in patients with cerebral diseases.

## Preventative measures

### Primary prevention in hospitalized patients
**As per KSEBPR/KSN 2022 guidelines:**
(A) Administer Isotonic fluids as maintenance fluid therapy to prevent hyponatremia in hospitalized pediatric patients over 1 month and under 18 years of age.
(I)  Insufficient evidence to support administering isotonic fluids as maintenance fluid therapy to prevent hyponatremia in neonates because of the risk of hypernatremia.
