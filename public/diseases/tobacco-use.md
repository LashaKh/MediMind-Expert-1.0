As per USPSTF 2021 guidelines: Advise all adult tobacco users to stop using tobacco and provide behavioral interventions. (A)

### Behavioral interventions, providers
As per USPHS 2008 guidelines:
- Provide tobacco dependence treatment even if specialized assessments are not used or available. (A)
- Advise all patients using tobacco to quit because evidence shows that physician advice to quit smoking increases abstinence rates. (A)
- Provide smoking cessation interventions by all clinicians as treatment delivered by a variety of clinician types increases abstinence rates. (A)

### Behavioral interventions, approaches:
As per WHO 2024 guidelines: Offer a combination of pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions to support tobacco users interested in quitting. (A)

As per USPHS 2008 guidelines:

### Behavioral interventions, intensity:
As per WHO 2024 guidelines: 
Offer more-intensive behavioral support, including individual face-to-face counseling (A)e-to-face counseling, telephone counseling, or a combination, in all tobacco users interested in quitting. (B)

As per USPHS 2008 guidelines:
- Provide multiple counseling sessions as much as possible, in addition to medication, in patients trying to quit smoking. (A)
- Offer at least a minimal intervention (lasting < 3 minutes) in all patients using tobacco, whether or not the patient is referred to intensive intervention. (A)
- Offer intensive interventions over less intensive interventions, whenever possible, as there is a strong dose-response relation between the session length of person-to-person contact and successful treatment outcomes. (A)
- Strive to meet ≥ 4 times with the patients quitting tobacco use if feasible, to increase the abstinence rates. (A)

### E-cigarettes:
As per USPSTF 2021 guidelines: Insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of electronic cigarettes for tobacco cessation in adults, including pregnant persons. Direct patients using tobacco to other tobacco cessation interventions with proven effectiveness and established safety. (I)

### Updated evidence: EFFECT (electronic cigarettes vs. placebo)
In participants aged 25-75 years who smoked daily and had volunteered to quit smoking, electronic cigarettes were superior to placebo with respect to confirmed abstinence at week 26.

As per USPHS 2008 guidelines: Identify patients using cigars, pipes, or other non-cigarette forms of smoking tobacco, strongly urge them to quit, and offer the same counseling interventions recommended for cigarette smokers. (B)

### Pregnant patients:
As per USPSTF 2021 guidelines:
- Ask all pregnant persons about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions for cessation. (A)
- Insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy interventions for tobacco cessation in pregnant persons. (I)

As per USPHS 2008 guidelines:
- Offer person-to-person psychosocial interventions exceeding minimal advice to quit whenever possible in pregnant patients using tobacco because of the serious risks of smoking to the pregnant patient and the fetus. (A)
- Offer effective tobacco dependence interventions to pregnant patients using tobacco at the first prenatal visit and throughout the course of pregnancy as, although abstinence early in pregnancy will produce the greatest benefits to the fetus and expectant mother, quitting at any point in pregnancy can yield benefits. (B)

### Pediatric patients, assessment
As per USPHS 2008 guidelines:
- Ask children and adolescents about tobacco use and provide a strong message regarding the importance of totally abstaining from tobacco use. (B)

- Recognize that cessation counseling delivered in pediatric settings has been shown to be effective in increasing abstinence among parents using tobacco. Ask parents about tobacco use and offer them cessation advice and assistance to protect children from secondhand smoke. (B)

### Patients with coronary artery disease
As per ACC/ACCP/AHA/.../PCNA 2023 guidelines:

- Advise smoking cessation at every visit in regular smokers. (A)
- Offer behavioral interventions in combination with pharmacotherapy, including bupropion, varenicline, or a combination of long- and short-acting nicotine replacement therapy, to maximize cessation rates. (A)
- Consider offering varenicline over bupropion or nicotine replacement therapy to increase cessation rates. (C)
- Consider offering short-term nicotine-containing e-cigarettes to aid smoking cessation, recognizing that the risk of sustained use and unknown long-term safety may outweigh the benefits. (C)

- Assess patients experiencing a relapse to determine whether they are willing to make another quit attempt. (B)

### Weight gain after quitting smoking:
As per USPHS 2008 guidelines: Consider prescribing bupropion sustained-release or nicotine replacement therapy (in particular, nicotine gum and nicotine lozenge) to delay weight gain after quitting in patients greatly concerned about weight gain. (C)

## Quality Improvement

### Documentation:
As per WHO 2024 guidelines: Ensure that all healthcare facilities include tobacco use status and use of tobacco cessation interventions in their medical records (including electronic health records), to facilitate provider interaction with tobacco users and increase adoption and maintenance of evidence-based treatment interventions. (B)

### Health service coverage:
As per WHO 2024 guidelines: Ensure that evidence-based tobacco cessation interventions are provided at no or reduced cost in all tobacco users interested in quitting. Prefer no cost over reduced cost. (B)

As per USPHS 2008 guidelines:
- Include treatments proved to be effective for smoking cessation as covered services in public and private health benefit plans as providing tobacco dependence treatments (both medication and counseling) as a paid or covered benefit by health insurance plans has been shown to increase the proportion of smokers proceeding to cessation treatment, attempting to quit and successfully quitting. (A)
- Provide tobacco dependence treatments shown to be effective (both counseling and medication) in all patients using tobacco as they are highly cost-effective relative to other reimbursed treatments. (A)
