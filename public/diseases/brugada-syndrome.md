# Brugada Syndrome


## Background

### Overview

#### **Definition**
BS is a genetic disorder characterized by a specific pattern on ECG and an increased risk of SCD due to ventricular arrhythmia.

#### **Pathophysiology**
The pathophysiology of BS involves dysfunction of the cardiac sodium channels. Mutations in the SCN5A gene, which encodes the predominant cardiac sodium channel alpha subunit NaV1.5, have been identified in some patients with BS.

#### **Epidemiology**
The incidence of BS in Japan is estimated at 14.2 per 100,000 person-years.

#### **Risk factors**
Risk factors for BS include a family history of the syndrome and the presence of specific genetic mutations. The SCN5A gene is the most frequently mutated gene in BS.

#### **Disease course**
The clinical course of BS can vary, but common symptoms include recurrent syncope, VF, and SCD. Some patients may remain asymptomatic, while others may experience symptoms such as unheralded syncope and nocturnal agonal respiration.

#### **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**
The prognosis of BS is variable and depends on several factors. Patients who have experienced aborted SCD or syncope have a higher risk of future cardiac events, with annual event rates of 7.7% and 1.9%, respectively.

## Screening and Diagnosis

### Diagnosis

As per ESC 2022 guidelines:
- **Diagnose BS** in patients with spontaneous type 1 Brugada ECG pattern and no other heart disease. (B)
- **Diagnose BS** in patients survived a cardiac arrest due to VF or polymorphic VT, exhibiting type 1 Brugada ECG induced by sodium channel blocker challenge or during fever, and with no other heart disease. (B)
- **Suspect BS** in patients with induced type 1 Brugada pattern having at least one of the following and with no other heart disease: (B)
  - arrhythmic syncope or nocturnal agonal respiration
  - family history of BS
  - family history of sudden death (< 45 years old) with a negative autopsy and circumstance suspicious for BS
- **Consider suspecting BS** in patients exhibiting induced type 1 Brugada ECG with no other heart disease. (C)

As per APHRS/EHRA/HRS 2013 guidelines:
- **Diagnose BS** in patients with ST-segment elevation with type 1 morphology ≥ 2 mm in ≥ 1 lead among the right precordial leads V1, V2, positioned in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th intercostal space occurring either spontaneously or after provocative drug test with IV administration of class I antiarrhythmic drugs. (B)
- **Diagnose BS** in patients with type 2 or type 3 ST-segment elevation in ≥ 1 lead among the right precordial leads V1, V2 positioned in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th intercostal space when a provocative drug test with IV administration of class I antiarrhythmic drugs induces a type I ECG morphology. (B)

## Diagnostic Investigations

### Drug challenge testing
- **As per ESC 2022 guidelines:** Do not obtain sodium channel blocker testing in patients with a prior type 1 Brugada pattern. (D)
- **As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines:** Consider obtaining pharmacological challenge testing with a sodium channel blocker in patients with suspected BS in the absence of spontaneous type 1 Brugada ECG pattern. (C)

### Genetic testing
- **As per ESC 2022 guidelines:** Obtain genetic testing for SCN5A gene mutation in probands with BS. (B)
- **As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines:**
  - Consider providing genetic counseling and obtaining genetic testing to facilitate cascade screening of relatives in patients with suspected or established BS. (C)
  - Provide genetic counseling and obtaining mutation-specific genetic testing in first-degree relatives of patients with a causative mutation for BS. (B)
- **As per EHRA/HRS 2011 guidelines:**
  - Obtain mutation-specific genetic testing in family members and appropriate relatives following the identification of BS-causative mutation in an index case. (A)
  - Consider obtaining comprehensive or type 1 BS-targeted (SCN5A) genetic testing in patients with suspected BS based on examination of the patient's clinical history, family history, and expressed ECG (resting 12-lead ECGs and/or provocative drug challenge testing) phenotype. (C)
  - Do not obtain genetic testing in the setting of an isolated type 2 or type 3 Brugada ECG pattern. (D)

## Diagnostic Procedures

### Implantable loop recorder
- **As per ESC 2022 guidelines:** Consider implanting a loop recorder in patients with BS with unexplained syncope. (C)

### Electrophysiology study
- **As per ESC 2022 guidelines:** Consider performing programmed electrical stimulation in asymptomatic patients with a spontaneous type I BS ECG pattern. (C)
- **As per ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines:** Consider obtaining an electrophysiological study with programmed ventricular stimulation using single and double extra stimuli for further risk stratification in patients with asymptomatic BS and spontaneous type 1 Brugada ECG pattern. (C)
- **As per ESC 2018 guidelines:** Consider obtaining an invasive electrophysiology study in patients with Brugada ECG pattern and syncope of suspected arrhythmic etiology. (C)

## Medical Management

### Avoidance of aggravating factors
As per ESC 2022 guidelines:
