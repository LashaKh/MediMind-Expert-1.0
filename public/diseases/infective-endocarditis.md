# Infective Endocarditis

## Background

### Overview

#### **Definition**
IE is a disease characterized by infection and inflammation of the endocardium, the layer of endothelial cells that lines the chambers and valves of the heart. 1

#### **Pathophysiology**
IE is most commonly caused by Streptococci and Staphylococci (80% cases), with S. aureus being the most common pathogen. Risk factors include the presence of cardiac prosthetic material (prosthetic valves, intracardiac devices) or abnormal valvular tissue (non-repaired cyanotic congenital heart diseases, chronic rheumatic heart disease, age-related degenerative valvular lesions), as well as intravenous drug use, and relative immunosuppression (including age ≥ 65 years, hemodialysis, diabetes, and HIV infection). 2

#### **Epidemiology**
The incidence of IE is approximately 15 cases per 100,000 person-years in the US. 3

#### **Disease course**
The altered cardiac valve surface produces a suitable site for bacteria in the bloodstream to attach and proliferate, creating vegetations that can detach and disseminate. Septic emboli from vegetations result in clinical manifestations of ischemic stroke, mycotic aneurysms, infarcts, and abscesses at various sites. Pulmonary, splenic, neurovascular, renal, and cardiac manifestations can ultimately lead to death. 1

#### **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**
IE is associated with 15-22% in-hospital mortality and 40% 5-year mortality in developed countries. The estimated risk of recurrence of IE is 1.3% per year. 2 4
