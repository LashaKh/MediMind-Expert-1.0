# Cardiac Arrest

## Background


### Overview

#### **What's New**

The updated American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) provide recommendations for the management of resuscitated patients after cardiac arrest. Primary PCI is recommended in the presence of evidence of STEMI for noncomatose patients and comatose patients with favorable prognostic features. It is also suggested for selected comatose patients with unfavorable prognostic features. Immediate angiography is not recommended for comatose, electrically and hemodynamically stable patients without evidence of STEMI.

#### **Definition**
Cardiac arrest is defined as the functional loss of mechanical cardiac activity, leading to cessation of systemic circulation.

#### **Pathophysiology**
The most common cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is ischemic heart disease, with up to 70% patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest having significant coronary artery disease on coronary angiography. In patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest, arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia represent the most common causes. Other causes of cardiac arrest include non-ischemic heart disease, as well as non-cardiac diseases (shock of any etiology, hypoxia, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, electrolyte and acid-base disturbances, drug overdose).

#### **Epidemiology**
In the US, the incidence of cardiac arrest is estimated at 55 cases per 100,000 person-years. The incidence of in-hospital cardiac arrest is estimated at 1-6 cases per 1,000 hospital admissions.

#### **Disease Course**
Patients who achieve ROSC after cardiac arrest have a high mortality rate, owing to the development of post-cardiac arrest syndrome, which is characterized by multi-organ dysfunction, including post-cardiac arrest brain injury and post-cardiac arrest myocardial dysfunction.

#### **Prognosis and Risk of Recurrence**
In patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 30-day survival is estimated at 5.8% in patients in whom CPR is not Performed, and 13.5-13.8% in patients in whom CPR is Performed. In patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest, 30-day survival is estimated at 28.3%.

- Attempt CPR unless contraindications exist. Recognize that fixed, dilated pupils, apparent rigor mortis, and dependent lividity are not contraindications to resuscitation in patients with severe hypothermia. (A)
- Initiate CPR if: no shock is advised on an automated external defibrillator; no carotid pulse is found after palpating for at least 1 minute; normal breathing or other signs of life are not observed; ultrasound is not available to verify cardiac activity or pulse. (B)
- Do not resuscitate patients with obvious fatal injuries or if the chest wall is too stiff for compressions. (D)
- Attempt to move patients with hypothermia to a warm setting, such as a ground or air ambulance or a medical facility where cardiac monitoring is available to guide resuscitation and to start rewarming. (B)- Feel carotid pulse for 1 minute before starting CPR. Initiate CPR, including rescue breathing, if a pulse is not palpated after 1 minute. (B)

Use the method most effectively delivering the highest concentration of oxygen if multiple modalities are available. Attempt bag-valve-mask or mouth-to-mouth ventilation if a modality or device fails. (B)
