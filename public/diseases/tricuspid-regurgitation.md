## Studies

### 2025 • TRISCEND II
In patients with severe symptomatic tricuspid regurgitation, valve replacement was superior to medical therapy with respect to a hierarchical composite of death, implantation of RV assist device or heart transplantation, postindex tricuspid valve intervention, hospitalization for HF, improvement in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary of ≥ 10 points, improvement in NYHA functional class of ≥ 1 point, improvement of at least 30 minutes on the 6 minutes walk distance at 1 year.

**Reference:** Rebecca T Hahn et al. N Engl J Med. 2025 Jan 9.

### 2025 • TRI-FR
In patients with severe isolated symptomatic tricuspid regurgitation, tricuspid TEER was superior to optimized medical therapy with respect to improvement in a composite clinical endpoint at 1 year, consisting of changes in NYHA class, patient global assessment, or the occurrence of major cardiovascular events.

**Reference:** Erwan Donal et al. JAMA. 2025 Jan 14.

### 2023 • Dexmedetomidine for Postoperative Delirium
In adult ICU patients undergoing cardiac surgery, dexmedetomidine was superior to propofol with respect to duration of mechanical ventilation.

**Reference:** M Preveden et al. Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2023 Aug.

### 2018 • Zochios
In adult patients with pre-existing respiratory disease undergoing elective cardiac surgery, high-flow nasal oxygen was superior to standard oxygen therapy with respect to the total length of hospital stay.

**Reference:** V Zochios et al. Anaesthesia. 2018 Dec.

### 2013 • RE-ALIGN
In patients who had undergone aortic or mitral valve replacement within the past 7 days and those who had undergone such replacement at least 3 months earlier, dabigatran was inferior to warfarin with respect to death, stroke, systemic embolism, or myocardial infarction.

**Reference:** Eikelboom JW et al. N Engl J Med. 2013 Sep 26.

### 2010 • TRACS
In adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, a restrictive strategy was noninferior to a liberal strategy with respect to death from all causes and severe morbidity during the hospital stay.

## Diagnostic Investigations

As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines, 
**Transthoracic echocardiography:** 
Obtain TTE in patients with TR to evaluate the presence and severity of TR, determine the etiology, measure the sizes of right-sided chambers and IVC, assess RV systolic function, estimate pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and characterize any associated left-sided heart disease. (B)

## Diagnostic Procedures

As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines, 
**Cardiac catheterization:** 
Consider obtaining invasive measurement of the cardiac index, right-sided diastolic pressures, pulmonary artery pressures, and pulmonary vascular resistance, as well as right ventriculography in patients with TR, if clinical and noninvasive data are discordant or inadequate. (C)

## Medical Management

### Pharmacotherapy
As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines:

- Consider offering diuretics in patients with signs and symptoms of right-sided HF attributable to severe TR (stages C and D). (C)

- Consider treating the primary causes of HF (such as pulmonary vasodilators to reduce elevated pulmonary artery pressures, guideline-directed medical therapy for HF with reduced LVEF or rhythm control of AF) in patients with signs and symptoms of right-sided HF attributable to severe secondary TR (stages C and D). (C)

## Therapeutic Procedures

As per EACTS/ESC 2022 guidelines, 
**Transcatheter tricuspid valve intervention:** 
Consider performing transcatheter intervention in symptomatic inoperable patients with secondary severe TR at a heart valve center with expertise in the treatment of tricuspid valve disease. (C)

## Surgical Interventions

### Indications for Surgery, Asymptomatic Patients:

As per EACTS/ESC 2022 guidelines, Consider performing surgery in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with isolated severe primary TR and RV dilatation being appropriate candidates for surgery. (C)

As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines, Consider performing isolated tricuspid valve surgery in asymptomatic patients with severe primary TR (stage C) and progressive RV dilation or systolic dysfunction. (C)

### Indications for Surgery, Symptomatic Patients:

As per EACTS/ESC 2022 guidelines:
- Perform surgery in patients with severe primary (B) or secondary TR undergoing left-sided valve surgery. **EvEvidence Level: B
- Perform surgery in symptomatic patients with isolated severe primary TR without severe RV dysfunction. (B)
- Consider performing surgery in patients with moderate primary TR undergoing left-sided valve surgery. (C)
- Consider performing surgery in patients with mild or moderate secondary TR with annular dilation (≥ 40 mm or > 21 mm/m² by 2D echocardiography) undergoing left-sided valve surgery. (C)
- Consider performing surgery in patients (symptomatic or having RV dilatation) with severe secondary TR (with or without previous left-sided surgery), in the absence of severe RV or LV dysfunction and severe pulmonary vascular disease/hypertension. (C)

As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines:
- Perform tricuspid valve surgery in patients with severe TR (stages C and D) undergoing left-sided valve surgery. (B)
- Consider performing tricuspid valve surgery in patients with progressive TR (stage B) undergoing left-sided valve surgery in the context of tricuspid annular dilation (tricuspid annulus end diastolic diameter > 4.0 cm) or prior signs and symptoms of right-sided HF. (C)
- Consider performing isolated tricuspid valve surgery to reduce symptoms and recurrent hospitalizations in patients with signs and symptoms of right-sided HF and severe primary TR (stage D), as well as in patients with severe isolated secondary TR attributable to annular dilation (in the absence of pulmonary hypertension or left-sided disease) poorly responding to medical therapy (Stage D). (C)
- Consider performing reoperation with isolated tricuspid valve surgery in patients with signs and symptoms of right-sided HF and severe TR (Stage D) undergone previous left-sided valve surgery, in the absence of severe pulmonary hypertension or severe RV systolic dysfunction. (C)

## Specific Circumstances

As per EACTS/ESC 2022 guidelines, 
**Patients with tricuspid stenosis:** 
Perform surgery in symptomatic patients with severe tricuspid stenosis and in patients with severe tricuspid stenosis undergoing left-sided valve intervention. (B)

### Pregnant Patients, Before Pregnancy
As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines:
- Obtain clinical evaluation and TTE in female patients with suspected valve disease contemplating pregnancy. (B)
- Provide pre-pregnancy counseling by a cardiologist with expertise in managing valvular heart disease during pregnancy in female patients with severe valve disease (stages C-D) contemplating pregnancy. (B)
- Consider obtaining exercise testing before pregnancy for risk assessment in asymptomatic female patients with severe valve disease (stage C1) contemplating pregnancy. (C)
- Perform intervention before pregnancy on the basis of standard indications in symptomatic female patients with severe valvular heart disease contemplating pregnancy. (B)
- Use a prosthetic valve based on a shared decision-making process accounting for the patient's values and preferences (including discussion of the risks of mechanical valves during pregnancy and the reduced durability of bioprosthetic valves in young females) in patients requiring a valve intervention before pregnancy. (B)
- Prefer bioprosthetic over mechanical valves in female patients of childbearing age requiring valve replacement because of the increased maternal and fetal risks of mechanical heart valves in pregnancy. (B)

### Pregnant Patients, During Pregnancy
As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines:
- Obtain monitoring of pregnant patients with severe valve disease (stages C-D) in a tertiary-care center with a dedicated heart valve team of cardiologists, surgeons, anesthesiologists, and maternal-fetal medicine obstetricians with expertise in the management of high-risk cardiac conditions during pregnancy. (B)
- Consider offering β-blockers as required for HR control or treatment of arrhythmias in pregnant patients with valvular heart disease. (C)
- Consider offering diuretic medications, if needed for volume overload, in pregnant patients with valvular heart disease and HF symptoms. (C)
- Do not use ACEis and ARBs in pregnant patients with valvular heart disease because of fetal risk. (D)
- Consider performing valve surgery during pregnancy in patients with severe valve regurgitation and NYHA class IV HF symptoms (stage D) refractory to medical therapy. (C)
- Do not perform valve surgeries in the absence of severe HF symptoms refractory to medical therapy in pregnant patients with valvular heart disease. (D)

### Patients Undergoing Non-cardiac Surgery
As per ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines:
- Obtain preoperative echocardiography in patients with clinically suspected moderate or greater degrees of valvular regurgitation undergoing noncardiac surgery. (B)
- Perform valvular intervention before elective noncardiac surgery to reduce perioperative risk if possible, depending on the urgency and risk of the noncardiac procedure, in patients meeting standard indications for intervention for valvular heart disease (replacement and repair) based on symptoms and disease severity. (B)
