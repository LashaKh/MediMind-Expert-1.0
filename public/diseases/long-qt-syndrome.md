## Screening and Diagnosis

### Diagnostic Criteria

**As per ESC 2022 guidelines:**
- Diagnose long QT syndrome with either QTc ≥ 480 ms in repeated 12-lead ECGs with or without symptoms or long QT syndrome diagnostic score > 3.  (B)
- Consider diagnosing long QT syndrome in the presence of a QTc ≥ 460 ms and < 480 ms in repeated 12-lead ECGs in patients with an arrhythmic syncope, in the absence of secondary causes for QT prolongation. (C)
- Diagnose long QT syndrome in the presence of a pathogenic mutation irrespective of the QT duration.  (B)

**As per APHRS/EHRA/HRS 2013 guidelines:**
- Diagnose long QT syndrome in the presence of the following:
  - Long QT syndrome risk score ≥ 3.5 in the absence of a secondary cause for QT prolongation and/or
  - Unequivocally pathogenic mutation in one of the long QT syndrome genes or
  - QT interval corrected for HR using Bazett's formula (QTc) ≥ 500 ms in repeated 12-lead ECG and in the absence of a secondary cause for QT prolongation  (B)
- Consider diagnosing long QT syndrome in the presence of a QTc of 480-499 ms in repeated 12-lead ECGs in patients with unexplained syncope in the absence of a secondary cause for QT prolongation and in the absence of a pathogenic mutation. (C)

## Classification and Risk Stratification

### Risk Assessment
- **ESC 2022 guidelines:** Consider calculating the arrhythmic risk before initiation of therapy based on the genotype and duration of QTc interval in patients with long QT syndrome. (C)
As per APHRS/EHRA/HRS 2013 guidelines: Refer patients with long QT syndrome wishing to engage in competitive sports to a clinical expert for risk assessment. (A)

## Diagnostic Investigations

### ECG
- **ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines:** Consider obtaining ambulatory ECG monitoring, exercise treadmill testing, and/or recording the ECG lying and immediately on standing for establishing a diagnosis and monitoring the response to therapy in patients with suspected long QT syndrome. (C)

### Epinephrine Challenge Testing
- **ESC 2022 guidelines:** Do not obtain routine epinephrine challenge testing in patients with long QT syndrome. (D)

### Genetic Testing

**ESC 2022 guidelines:**

**ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines:**
- Provide genetic counseling and obtain genetic testing in patients with clinically diagnosed long QT syndrome.  (B)
- Provide genetic counseling and obtain mutation-specific genetic testing in first-degree relatives of patients having a causative mutation for long QT syndrome.  (B)

As per EHRA/HRS 2011 guidelines:
- Obtain comprehensive or LQT1-3 (KCNQ1, KCNH2, and SCN5A) targeted long QT syndrome genetic testing in any patient with an established strong clinical index of suspicion for long QT syndrome based on clinical history, family history, and expressed ECG (resting 12-lead ECGs and/or provocative stress testing with exercise or catecholamine infusion). (A)
- Obtain comprehensive or LQT1-3 (KCNQ1, KCNH2, and SCN5A) targeted long QT syndrome genetic testing in any asymptomatic patient with QT prolongation, defined as QTc > 480 ms (prepuberty) or > 500 ms (adults), in the absence of other QT-prolonging clinical conditions (such as electrolyte abnormalities, hypertrophy, bundle branch block) on serial 12-lead ECGs. (A)
- Consider obtaining comprehensive or LQT1-3 (KCNQ1, KCNH2, and SCN5A) targeted long QT syndrome genetic testing in any asymptomatic patient with otherwise idiopathic QTc values > 460 ms (prepuberty) or > 480 ms (adults) on serial 12-lead ECGs. (C)
- Obtain mutation-specific genetic testing in family members and other appropriate relatives subsequently following the identification of the long QT syndrome-causative mutation in an index case. (A)
- Consider obtaining comprehensive or targeted (RYR2, KCNQ1, KCNH2, and SCN5A) ion channel genetic testing in the setting of autopsy-negative sudden unexplained death syndrome in an attempt to establish probable cause and manner of death and to facilitate the identification of potentially at-risk relatives as well as if circumstantial evidence points toward a clinical diagnosis of long QT syndrome or catecholaminergic polymorphic VT specifically (such as emotional stress, acoustic trigger, drowning as the trigger of death). (C)

## Diagnostic Procedures

### Electrophysiology Study
