# Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy

## Background

### Overview

#### **Definition**
ARVC is a genetically inherited cardiomyopathy characterized by the replacement of normal heart muscle with fibrofatty tissue, predominantly in the right ventricle.¹

#### **Pathophysiology**
ARVC is caused by the fibrofatty replacement of the myocardium predisposing the heart to electrical instability, leading to ventricular arrhythmias.¹

#### **Epidemiology**
The prevalence of ARVC worldwide is estimated at 20 per 100,000 population.²

#### **Disease Course**
Clinically, ARVC can present with a variety of symptoms. The most common presenting symptoms include palpitations, syncope, and SCD. Some patients may also develop signs of HF.³

#### **Prognosis and Risk of Recurrence**
The prognosis of ARVC is variable. It is associated with an increased risk of SCD, particularly in young individuals, and may be the first manifestation of the disease.¹

## Screening and Diagnosis

### Screening of Family Relatives, Clinical and Genetic Testing

**As per ESC 2023 guidelines:**
- Obtain cascade genetic testing, with pre- and post-test counseling, in adult at-risk relatives of a patient with cardiomyopathy with a confident genetic diagnosis (a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant) in the family (starting with first-degree relatives, if available, and cascading out sequentially). (B)
- Consider obtaining cascade genetic testing with pre- and post-test counseling in pediatric at-risk relatives of a patient with cardiomyopathy with a confident genetic diagnosis (a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant) in the family (starting with first-degree relatives, if available, and cascading out sequentially), considering the underlying cardiomyopathy, expected age of onset, presentation in the family, and clinical/legal consequences. (C)
- Consider obtaining testing for the presence of a familial variant of unknown significance, typically in parents and/or affected relatives, to determine if the variant segregates with the cardiomyopathy phenotype and if this might allow the variant to be interpreted with confidence. (C)
- Do not obtain diagnostic genetic testing in phenotype-negative relatives of a patient with cardiomyopathy in the absence of a confident genetic diagnosis (a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant) in the family. (D)
- Consider obtaining a clinical evaluation of close relatives (second-degree relatives of the index patient) during cascade screening where a first-degree relative has died. (C)
