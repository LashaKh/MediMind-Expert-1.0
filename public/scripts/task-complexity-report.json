      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement document deduplication logic",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the document deduplication logic implementation into specific subtasks including URL-based checking, content hash comparison, user messaging, and the 'force update' feature.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing multiple deduplication checks (URL and content hash) and user interactions. It has moderate complexity due to the need for different validation strategies and user feedback mechanisms."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Populate OpenAI vector store with document content",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the OpenAI vector store population task into subtasks covering API integration, error handling and retry logic, document status management, and performance optimization.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves external API integration with OpenAI, handling potential failures, implementing retry mechanisms, and updating document status. The external dependency and error handling requirements increase its complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Display uploaded documents on product detail page",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the document display component implementation into subtasks for component creation, data fetching, UI layout/styling, and document management operations.",
      "reasoning": "This is a standard UI component implementation with data fetching and basic CRUD operations. The complexity is moderate, requiring component creation, styling, and document management functionality."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 11,
      "taskTitle": "Implement product research trigger and webhook integration",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the product research webhook integration into subtasks covering UI button implementation, sequential webhook calling, loading state management, results display component, and error handling.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple external API calls with sequential dependencies, UI state management, and results visualization. The orchestration of multiple webhooks and handling their responses adds complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 12,
      "taskTitle": "Create chat UI with product selection",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the chat UI implementation into subtasks for component structure, product selection dropdown, message display area, and input handling with state management.",
      "reasoning": "Creating a functional chat UI requires multiple components, state management for messages, and product selection functionality. The UI complexity and interaction patterns make this a moderately complex task."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 13,
      "taskTitle": "Implement dynamic assistant connection to vector stores",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the dynamic assistant implementation into subtasks for product context retrieval, OpenAI assistant connection, system prompt injection, chat functionality implementation, and error/rate limit handling.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the dynamic connection to different vector stores, OpenAI API integration, context management, and handling of API limitations. It requires careful orchestration of multiple technical components."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 14,
      "taskTitle": "Implement advanced vector store management",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the vector store management implementation into subtasks for change detection, atomic vector store recreation, service function development, loading state management, and comprehensive error handling.",
      "reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks due to the need for atomic operations when updating vector stores, handling document changes, and ensuring data consistency. The requirement for rebuilding vector stores adds significant complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 15,
      "taskTitle": "Implement product filtering and UI refinements",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the UI refinement task into subtasks for implementing search/filtering functionality, responsive design improvements, and loading/error state enhancements.",
      "reasoning": "This task is relatively straightforward, focusing on UI improvements and basic filtering functionality. The complexity is lower as it enhances existing components rather than creating new complex functionality."
