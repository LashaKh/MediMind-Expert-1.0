# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Specialty Selection During Onboarding
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the onboarding flow that allows users to select their medical specialty after registration.
# Details:
Create OnboardingFlow component with steps indicator. Implement SpecialtySelection component with options for Cardiology and OB/GYN. Create AboutMeForm for collecting context information. Implement API function to update user profile with specialty and about_me_context. Ensure users cannot skip specialty selection. Create redirect logic to appropriate workspace after completion.

# Test Strategy:
Test the complete onboarding flow. Verify data is correctly saved to the database. Ensure users cannot access the application without completing specialty selection. Test the redirect logic to specialty-specific workspaces.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create OnboardingFlow Component with Stepper UI [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the main container component for the onboarding process with a step indicator to show progress through the flow
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a new OnboardingFlow.jsx component
2. Implement a stepper UI component showing steps (Specialty Selection, About Me, Completion)
3. Set up state management for tracking current step
4. Create a layout with header, content area, and navigation buttons
5. Implement next/back navigation logic between steps
6. Add conditional rendering for different step content
7. Style the component according to design guidelines

Testing approach:
- Verify stepper UI displays correctly
- Test navigation between steps
- Ensure responsive layout works on different screen sizes

## 2. Implement SpecialtySelection Component [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create the specialty selection screen with options for Cardiology and OB/GYN specialties
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a new SpecialtySelection.jsx component
2. Design and implement UI cards for each specialty option (Cardiology, OB/GYN)
3. Add specialty icons and descriptions for each option
4. Implement selection state management
5. Add validation to ensure a specialty is selected
6. Create visual feedback for selected specialty
7. Implement error handling for required selection

Testing approach:
- Verify all specialty options render correctly
- Test selection and deselection of specialties
- Ensure validation prevents continuing without selection
- Test accessibility of selection components

## 3. Create AboutMeForm Component [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop a form to collect additional context information about the user
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a new AboutMeForm.jsx component
2. Implement form fields for collecting relevant information (years of experience, practice setting, etc.)
3. Add form validation for required fields
4. Implement state management for form data
5. Create field-level error handling and feedback
6. Design a clean and intuitive form layout
7. Add help text/tooltips for clarity on what information to provide

Testing approach:
- Test form submission with valid and invalid data
- Verify all validation rules work correctly
- Test form reset functionality
- Ensure form state persists if user navigates back from next step

## 4. Update Database Schema and API Endpoints [done]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Modify the database schema and create API endpoints to store user specialty and about_me information
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Update user database schema to include specialty (string) and about_me_context (text) fields
2. Create database migration scripts
3. Implement API endpoint for updating user profile with specialty information
4. Create API endpoint for updating about_me_context
5. Add proper validation on the backend
6. Implement error handling for API responses
7. Create documentation for the new API endpoints

Testing approach:
- Test API endpoints with valid and invalid data
- Verify database updates correctly
- Test error handling for various scenarios
- Ensure proper authentication/authorization checks

## 5. Implement API Integration in Onboarding Components [done]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Connect the frontend components to the backend API for saving user specialty and context information
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create API service functions to call the backend endpoints
2. Implement data submission in the OnboardingFlow component
3. Add loading states during API calls
4. Implement error handling for failed API requests
5. Add success feedback after successful submission
6. Create retry logic for failed submissions
7. Implement data validation before submission

Testing approach:
- Test successful API integration
- Verify error handling for network issues
- Test loading states display correctly
- Ensure proper error messages are shown to users

## 6. Implement Routing Logic and Guards [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.5
### Description: Create routing logic to guide users through onboarding and redirect to appropriate workspace after completion
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create route guards to prevent skipping onboarding
2. Implement redirect logic after onboarding completion
3. Add specialty-based routing to direct users to appropriate workspace
4. Create a service to check onboarding completion status
5. Implement persistence of onboarding progress
6. Add route for resuming incomplete onboarding
7. Create a completion screen with transition to main application

Testing approach:
- Test route guards prevent unauthorized access
- Verify redirects work correctly after completion
- Test specialty-based routing logic
- Ensure onboarding state persists across page refreshes
