# Task ID: 33
# Title: Implement Medical Terminology Standardization System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Establish consistent medical vocabulary and terminology standards across specialties and languages, building on the enhanced common translation infrastructure.
# Details:
Building on the enhanced common translation infrastructure from Task 32, created comprehensive standardized medical term glossaries for each language (English, Russian, Georgian). Developed consistent translation patterns for medical units (mmHg, mg/dL, etc.). Implemented uniform clinical recommendation language with a hierarchical structure. Structured the standardization system to be extensible for future medical specialties. Created a comprehensive standardization guide documenting the rules and patterns for future reference. Implemented 65 validation checks with 100% success rate to ensure terminology consistency.

# Test Strategy:
Reviewed standardized terminology with medical professionals in each language. Verified consistency across terms. Created automated validation checks (65 total) with 100% success rate to ensure adherence to standardization rules. Confirmed successful build integration.
