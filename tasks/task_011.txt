# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Chat Interface Components
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core chat interface components for the AI Medical Co-Pilot.
# Details:
Create ChatWindow container component. Implement MessageList component for displaying chat history. Create MessageItem components for user and AI messages. Implement MessageInput component with text area and send button. Add typing indicators for AI responses. Create UI for displaying source references. Implement chat window scrolling behavior. Style components according to design system with Tailwind CSS.

# Test Strategy:
Test chat interface with mock messages. Verify responsive design on different screen sizes. Test scrolling behavior with many messages. Ensure accessibility compliance for the chat interface.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create ChatWindow Container Component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the main ChatWindow container component that will hold all other chat interface elements
### Details:
Create a React component called ChatWindow that serves as the container for the entire chat interface. This component should:
- Define the overall layout structure for the chat UI
- Handle the main state management for chat messages
- Create a responsive container with appropriate height/width constraints
- Implement Tailwind CSS styling according to the design system
- Set up the basic scroll container for the message area
- Add appropriate accessibility attributes (aria-labels, roles)

Testing approach: Verify the component renders correctly and has the proper structure to contain child components.

## 2. Implement MessageList Component [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Create the MessageList component to display the chat history with proper scrolling behavior
### Details:
Develop a MessageList component that:
- Accepts an array of message objects as props
- Implements auto-scrolling to the most recent message
- Handles proper spacing between messages
- Creates a virtualized list for performance if many messages are present
- Maintains scroll position when viewing older messages
- Implements scroll-to-bottom functionality when new messages arrive
- Adds appropriate styling with Tailwind CSS

Testing approach: Test with various message arrays to ensure proper rendering, scrolling behavior, and responsiveness.

## 3. Create MessageItem Components for User and AI [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Implement separate MessageItem components for user and AI messages with appropriate styling
### Details:
Create MessageItem components that:
- Support different message types (user vs. AI)
- Display different styling based on message type (user messages right-aligned, AI messages left-aligned)
- Format message content appropriately (text, markdown, etc.)
- Show timestamps for messages
- Include user/AI avatars or icons
- Handle message status indicators (sent, delivered, etc.)
- Apply Tailwind CSS styling according to design system

Testing approach: Test rendering of both user and AI message types with various content formats and verify styling differences.

## 4. Implement MessageInput Component [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Create the MessageInput component with text area, send button, and basic validation
### Details:
Build a MessageInput component that:
- Creates a textarea for user input with appropriate sizing
- Implements a send button with proper styling and hover states
- Handles basic input validation (empty messages, max length)
- Supports multi-line input with shift+enter for new lines
- Implements auto-expanding height based on content
- Provides callback function for sending messages
- Clears input after sending
- Adds keyboard shortcuts (Enter to send)
- Applies Tailwind CSS styling according to design system

Testing approach: Test input functionality, validation, keyboard shortcuts, and verify the component properly calls the send callback.

## 5. Add Typing Indicators for AI Responses [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3
### Description: Implement typing indicators to show when the AI is generating a response
### Details:
Create typing indicator functionality that:
- Shows an animated indicator when AI is processing/responding
- Positions the indicator appropriately in the message list
- Creates a smooth animation using CSS/Tailwind
- Handles appearance/disappearance gracefully
- Provides appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility
- Includes a timeout mechanism for long-running responses

Testing approach: Test the appearance, animation, and timing of the typing indicator under various response timing scenarios.

## 6. Create UI for Displaying Source References [done]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Implement the UI components for displaying source references within AI messages
### Details:
Develop source reference UI components that:
- Display citation numbers within AI message text
- Create expandable/collapsible source reference sections
- Format reference information (title, URL, etc.)
- Add clickable links to original sources
- Implement hover states for reference previews
- Style consistently with the overall chat interface
- Handle multiple references per message

Testing approach: Test with various reference formats, multiple references, and verify expanding/collapsing functionality works correctly.

## 7. Implement File Upload Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 11.4
### Description: Add file upload capabilities to the chat interface for sharing documents
### Details:
Create file upload functionality that:
- Adds an upload button/icon to the MessageInput component
- Implements file selection dialog
- Shows upload progress indicators
- Validates file types and sizes
- Displays thumbnails for uploaded files
- Allows cancellation of uploads
- Handles upload errors gracefully
- Integrates with the message sending flow

Testing approach: Test file selection, validation, upload progress, and integration with the message sending process with various file types and sizes.

## 8. Integrate Chat Components and Implement State Management [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5, 11.6, 11.7
### Description: Connect all chat components together and implement proper state management for the chat interface
### Details:
Integrate all components and implement state management:
- Connect MessageList, MessageItem, MessageInput components within ChatWindow
- Implement state management for messages (using context API, Redux, or similar)
- Create message handlers for sending/receiving messages
- Implement proper data flow between components
- Handle chat history persistence
- Manage loading states and error handling
- Ensure responsive behavior across device sizes
- Perform final styling adjustments for consistency

Testing approach: Perform integration testing of the complete chat interface, testing the full message flow from input to display, including all features like typing indicators and source references.
