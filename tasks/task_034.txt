# Task ID: 34
# Title: Refine Translation Key Pattern Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Optimize translation key structures based on successful patterns from TIMI/GRACE calculators.
# Details:
Analyze existing TIMI/GRACE calculator translations. Refine the nested translation key structure: calculators.{specialty}.{calculator_name}.{property}. Implement TypeScript interfaces for translation objects to ensure type safety. Establish conventions for validation messages: calculators.{specialty}.{calculator}.validation_{field}. Create documentation for the translation key patterns.

# Test Strategy:
Validate key structure consistency. Test TypeScript type checking. Verify backward compatibility with existing calculator translations.
