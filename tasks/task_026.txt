# Task ID: 26
# Title: Implement Error Handling and Fallbacks
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 13, 14, 19, 21
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive error handling and fallback UI components throughout the application.
# Details:
Implement global error boundary for React components. Create ErrorFallback component for displaying user-friendly error messages. Implement API error handling with appropriate user feedback. Create offline fallback pages for PWA. Implement retry mechanisms for failed API requests. Add logging for client-side errors. Create loading states and skeletons for asynchronous operations. Ensure consistent error messaging across the application.

# Test Strategy:
Test error handling with simulated component errors. Verify API error handling with mocked failed requests. Test offline fallbacks by disabling network. Ensure loading states display correctly during asynchronous operations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Global Error Boundary Component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a React error boundary component that catches JavaScript errors anywhere in the component tree and displays a fallback UI instead of crashing the application.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create an ErrorBoundary class component that uses componentDidCatch and getDerivedStateFromError lifecycle methods
2. Set up state to track when an error occurs
3. Implement the render method to show children when no error, or fallback UI when error occurs
4. Add error logging functionality within componentDidCatch
5. Create a higher-order component (HOC) to easily wrap any component with the error boundary
6. Test by deliberately throwing errors in a test component

Testing approach:
- Unit test the error boundary with Jest by simulating errors
- Verify fallback UI is displayed when errors occur
- Check that error information is properly captured

## 2. Create ErrorFallback Component and UI States [done]
### Dependencies: 26.1
### Description: Develop reusable ErrorFallback component with variations for different error scenarios and loading states/skeletons for async operations.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a base ErrorFallback component with props for error message, action buttons, and retry functionality
2. Design and implement different variations:
   - Network error fallback
   - Authentication error fallback
   - Permission error fallback
   - Generic error fallback
3. Create loading skeleton components for common UI elements (cards, lists, etc.)
4. Implement content placeholders for loading states
5. Ensure all components follow design system guidelines
6. Create storybook stories for each fallback and loading component

Testing approach:
- Visual testing with Storybook
- Unit tests for component rendering and prop variations
- Check accessibility of fallback components

## 3. Implement API Error Handling Middleware [done]
### Dependencies: 26.2
### Description: Create middleware for API requests that handles different error types, formats error messages, and provides consistent error responses throughout the application.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create an API error handling middleware/interceptor (using Axios interceptors or similar)
2. Implement error classification for different HTTP status codes (4xx, 5xx)
3. Create utility functions to extract and format error messages from API responses
4. Implement toast notifications for API errors using a notification library
5. Add context-aware error messages based on the failing request type
6. Create helper functions to standardize error handling across all API calls

Testing approach:
- Unit test error classification and message extraction
- Integration tests with mocked API responses
- Test different error scenarios (timeout, network error, server error, validation error)

## 4. Implement Retry Mechanisms for Failed Requests [done]
### Dependencies: 26.3
### Description: Create a system for automatically retrying failed API requests with exponential backoff and user-triggered manual retries.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a retry utility that implements exponential backoff algorithm
2. Integrate retry logic into API service layer
3. Add configuration options for max retry attempts, delay between retries
4. Implement different retry strategies based on error type (retry server errors, but not client errors)
5. Create UI components for manual retry (retry buttons, refresh indicators)
6. Add visual feedback during retry attempts

Testing approach:
- Unit test retry logic and backoff algorithm
- Test automatic retry with simulated network failures
- Test manual retry functionality
- Verify retry limits are respected

## 5. Implement Offline Fallback Pages for PWA [done]
### Dependencies: 26.2, 26.3
### Description: Create offline fallback pages and implement service worker caching strategies to ensure the application remains functional when offline.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a dedicated offline fallback page with helpful information
2. Configure service worker to serve the offline page when network requests fail
3. Implement cache-first strategies for critical assets
4. Add offline detection and status indicators in the UI
5. Create mechanisms to queue actions performed while offline
6. Implement sync functionality to process queued actions when connection is restored

Testing approach:
- Test offline functionality using browser dev tools' network throttling
- Verify offline page is displayed when network is unavailable
- Test that cached resources are accessible offline
- Verify offline-to-online transition behavior

## 6. Implement Client-Side Error Logging System [done]
### Dependencies: 26.1, 26.3, 26.4
### Description: Create a comprehensive client-side error logging system that captures JavaScript errors, API failures, and user context for debugging.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Set up error logging service (using a tool like Sentry, LogRocket, or custom solution)
2. Integrate with the global error boundary to capture React component errors
3. Add error logging to API error handling middleware
4. Implement unhandled promise rejection and global error event listeners
5. Add context enrichment to include user information, app state, and steps to reproduce
6. Create a mechanism to filter sensitive information before logging
7. Implement logging severity levels and appropriate handling for each

Testing approach:
- Verify errors are properly captured and sent to logging service
- Test with various error types (syntax errors, API errors, etc.)
- Check that appropriate context is included with error reports
- Verify sensitive information is not logged
