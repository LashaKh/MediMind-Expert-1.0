# Task ID: 32
# Title: Enhance Common Translation Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Expand shared terminology and common translation elements across the application to establish foundation for calculator-specific translations.
# Details:
Enhanced common.ts files for all three languages (en, ru, ka) which contain standard UI elements. Expanded medical.ts files with comprehensive medical terminology including: 1) Medical units (weight, length, blood pressure, lab values, time, volume, frequency), 2) Risk categories (low/moderate/high/very high, borderline, intermediate, etc.), 3) Clinical recommendation language (consultation, monitoring, treatment, lifestyle, emergency), 4) Calculator-specific shared terms (input labels, results, actions, validation), 5) Clinical terminology (patient demographics, assessment, treatment, follow-up, guidelines). All implementations follow the nested structure pattern: common.{category}.{property} for organization and consistency.

# Test Strategy:
Verified completeness of common translation keys across all languages. Validated medical terminology with healthcare professionals. Tested integration with i18next framework. Build tested successfully with no syntax errors.
