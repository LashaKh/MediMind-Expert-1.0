# Task ID: 10
# Title: Create User Profile Management UI
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the user profile management interface for viewing and editing profile information.
# Details:
Create ProfilePage component with user information display. Implement EditProfileForm for updating about_me_context. Create ChangePasswordForm component. Implement API functions for updating profile information. Add profile picture upload functionality. Ensure form validation and error handling. Style according to design system. Implement tabbed interface for Profile/Security/Preferences sections.

# Test Strategy:
Test profile information display and editing. Verify password change functionality. Test form validation for various inputs. Ensure API calls correctly update the database. Verify responsive design and accessibility features. Test tabbed interface navigation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create ChangePasswordForm component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a form component that allows users to securely change their password with current password verification
### Details:
Include fields for current password, new password, and confirm password. Implement real-time validation for password strength and matching confirmation.

<info added on 2025-05-29T10:38:26.782Z>
The component has been implemented with the following features:

- Password strength indicator that visually displays strength levels (weak/medium/strong)
- Throttled validation to prevent excessive API calls during typing
- Password requirements checklist that updates in real-time as user types
- Custom hooks for password validation logic (usePasswordValidation)
- Accessibility features including proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- Animated transitions for error/success states
- Session handling to prevent password change without valid session
- Proper form submission prevention during validation
- Comprehensive unit tests covering all validation scenarios and edge cases
- Mobile-responsive design with appropriate input types
- Integration with the application's notification system for success/error feedback
- Security timeout that clears sensitive form data after period of inactivity

Implementation uses React Hook Form for state management and zod for schema validation, with proper error boundary implementation.

## 2. Add profile picture upload functionality [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the ability for users to upload, crop, and update their profile pictures
### Details:
Create a dropzone for file uploads, add image preview functionality, implement basic image editing (crop/resize), and handle the file upload process to the server.

<info added on 2025-05-29T10:38:42.693Z>
I've implemented the ProfilePictureUpload component with comprehensive functionality:

The component uses react-dropzone for drag & drop with a 5MB size limit and validation for image types (jpg, png, webp). Images are processed client-side using browser Canvas API for cropping/resizing before upload.

Upload flow integrates with Supabase Storage, storing images in user-uploads/profile-pictures/${userId} path with UUID filenames. On successful upload, the profile_picture_url field in the user profile table is updated via a transaction to ensure data consistency.

Key features include:
- Hover overlay with edit/remove actions using Radix UI Popover
- Circular cropping with react-easy-crop (maintains 1:1 aspect ratio)
- Progressive loading with optimized thumbnails
- Accessibility: proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation for crop tool
- Error states with retry mechanism for network failures
- Skeleton loading state during initial fetch

Added user guidance with tooltip explaining supported formats and optimal image dimensions (recommended 400x400px minimum).

The component is fully responsive, adjusting crop interface for mobile devices with touch-friendly controls and simplified UI on smaller screens.

## 3. Improve form validation and error handling [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enhance the user experience with comprehensive form validation and clear error messaging
### Details:
Implement client-side validation for all profile form fields, display meaningful error messages, and ensure proper handling of server-side validation errors.

<info added on 2025-05-29T10:38:59.396Z>
Here's the additional information for the form validation subtask:

```
## Implementation Details

### Form Validation
- Implement `validateForm()` function to check all inputs before submission
- Add validation rules:
  - Name: 2-50 characters, alphanumeric with spaces
  - Email: RFC 5322 compliant validation
  - Password: Minimum 8 chars, require number, special char, uppercase
- Apply input sanitization: trim whitespace on all fields before validation
- Validate on blur and before form submission

### Error Handling
- Create dedicated error message component with proper styling
- Implement field-level error indicators with descriptive messages
- Add aria-invalid and aria-describedby attributes for accessibility
- Implement debounced validation to avoid excessive error messages

### Loading States
- Add loading spinner for form submission
- Disable submit button during processing
- Implement skeleton loaders for async data fetching
- Preserve form state during loading to prevent data loss

### Error Boundaries
- Create ProfileFormErrorBoundary component
- Implement graceful fallbacks for API failures
- Add error logging to monitoring service
- Provide user-friendly recovery options

### UX Improvements
- Add success message component with auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
- Implement toast notifications for form submission status
- Add form state persistence to prevent data loss on page refresh
- Implement keyboard navigation improvements for form fields
```

## 4. Create dedicated API functions for profile updates [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a set of API functions to handle various profile update operations
### Details:
Create separate functions for updating basic profile info, changing password, and uploading profile pictures. Ensure proper error handling and response processing.

<info added on 2025-05-29T10:39:14.538Z>
Based on the API integration work completed, here are additional technical details for the "Create dedicated API functions for profile updates" subtask:

The API functions have been implemented with the following structure:
- `updateBasicProfile(userData: UserProfileData): Promise<ApiResponse>`
- `changePassword(passwordData: PasswordChangeRequest): Promise<ApiResponse>` 
- `uploadProfilePicture(file: File): Promise<UploadResponse>`

Each function includes:
- Request validation before submission
- Proper typing with TypeScript interfaces (UserProfileData, PasswordChangeRequest)
- Consistent error response format with typed error codes
- Authentication header injection
- Automatic token refresh handling
- Rate limiting protection

The database schema update includes:
```sql
ALTER TABLE users 
ADD COLUMN profile_picture_url VARCHAR(255),
ADD COLUMN preferences JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb;
```

Migration script handles both schema updates and data backfilling for existing users.

TypeScript types have been updated in `src/types/user.ts` to reflect the new schema, maintaining backward compatibility.
