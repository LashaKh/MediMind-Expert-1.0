# Task ID: 42
# Title: Setup OB/GYN Translation Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create and organize OB/GYN-specific translation file structure for all three languages.
# Details:
Create obgyn.ts files within each language directory. Implement the structure defined in the technical architecture. Set up the base structure for all OB/GYN calculators. Include sections for calculator titles, descriptions, form fields, results, and recommendations. Ensure TypeScript strict mode compliance. Establish OB/GYN-specific common terminology.

# Test Strategy:
Verify file structure matches the technical architecture. Test TypeScript compilation. Validate integration with the i18next framework.
