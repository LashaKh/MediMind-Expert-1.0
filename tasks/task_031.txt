# Task ID: 31
# Title: Implement OpenAI Vector Store Document Upload System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 19, 20, 21
# Priority: high
# Description: Replace the current document processing system with OpenAI Vector Store integration for personal knowledge base documents, enabling more efficient document storage, retrieval, and semantic search capabilities.
# Details:
This task involves creating a complete system for uploading, processing, and managing documents using OpenAI's Vector Store:

1. Database Schema:
   - Create tables for document metadata (title, description, file_type, created_at, updated_at)
   - Add columns for OpenAI-specific data (file_id, vector_id, embedding_status)
   - Implement relationships between documents and user accounts

2. Edge Functions:
   - Develop secure upload function that accepts documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
   - Create processing function to send documents to OpenAI API
   - Implement webhook handler for OpenAI processing status updates
   - Build retrieval functions to fetch document content and metadata

3. UI Components:
   - Document upload interface with progress indicators
   - Document management dashboard (list, filter, search, delete)
   - Processing status visualization
   - Document detail view with metadata editing capabilities

4. Chat Integration:
   - Modify chat interface to query relevant documents from Vector Store
   - Implement document citation in chat responses
   - Add UI elements to show which documents were referenced

5. OpenAI Integration:
   - Implement file upload to OpenAI API
   - Store and manage OpenAI File IDs
   - Handle vector embedding generation and storage
   - Implement error handling and retry mechanisms

Ensure the system handles large documents appropriately, implements proper error handling, and provides clear feedback to users throughout the document processing lifecycle.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Test database schema with sample document entries
   - Verify edge functions handle various document types correctly
   - Test error handling for invalid files and API failures
   - Validate OpenAI API integration with mock responses

2. Integration Tests:
   - Upload various document types (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and verify processing
   - Test complete flow from upload to availability in chat
   - Verify webhook handling for processing status updates
   - Test document deletion and updates

3. UI/UX Testing:
   - Verify upload progress indicators function correctly
   - Test document management interface with various document states
   - Ensure error messages are clear and helpful
   - Validate responsive design on different devices

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure upload and processing times for various document sizes
   - Test system with multiple concurrent uploads
   - Verify chat response times when querying documents

5. Security Testing:
   - Verify proper authentication for document access
   - Test for potential injection vulnerabilities
   - Ensure secure handling of API keys and credentials

Acceptance Criteria:
- Users can upload documents of supported types
- Documents are successfully processed by OpenAI Vector Store
- Documents can be managed (viewed, edited, deleted) through the UI
- Chat system can reference and cite uploaded documents
- System handles errors gracefully with clear user feedback
