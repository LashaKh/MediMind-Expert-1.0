Recommend implementing strict origin validation.\n\n2. **Missing Security Headers**: Application lacks essential headers:\n   - Content-Security-Policy (CSP)\n   - X-XSS-Protection\n   - X-Frame-Options\n   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\n\n3. **Rate Limiting Gaps**: Authentication endpoints, password reset, and sensitive operations lack protection against brute force attacks. Implement rate limiting with Redis or similar technology.\n\n4. **CSRF Vulnerabilities**: No anti-CSRF tokens for state-changing operations. Implement token validation for all POST/PUT/DELETE requests.\n\n5. **HTTPS Implementation**: No forced HTTPS redirection in production environment. Add middleware to ensure all traffic uses secure connections.\n\n6. **XSS Prevention**: While validation exists, content sanitization is missing. Implement DOMPurify or equivalent for user-generated content.\n\n7. **Secure Storage Patterns**: Current storage mechanisms for user preferences lack encryption for sensitive data.\n\n**Strengths Identified:**\n- Robust input validation in medical calculators\n- Proper JWT implementation with Supabase\n- Well-structured RBAC system\n- Database-level RLS policies\n\n**Recommended Security Tools:**\n- Helmet.js for security headers\n- express-rate-limit for API protection\n- csurf for CSRF protection\n- DOMPurify for XSS prevention\n</info added on 2025-05-31T12:09:28.703Z>",
