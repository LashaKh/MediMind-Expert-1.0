# Task ID: 19
# Title: Develop Personal Document Upload Functionality
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the feature for uploading personal documents to the knowledge base.
# Details:
Create PersonalKnowledgeBasePage with document upload interface. Implement FileUpload component with drag-and-drop functionality. Create Netlify Function for handling document uploads to OpenAI. Implement document processing and vector store creation/updating. Create database operations for storing document metadata. Add progress indicators and status updates for uploads. Implement error handling for failed uploads. Style components according to design system.
