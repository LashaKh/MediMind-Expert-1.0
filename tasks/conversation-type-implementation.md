# Conversation Type Implementation Task Plan

## Overview
Update the ChatContext to properly support conversation types (general vs case-study) that are already defined in the type system but not fully implemented.

## Current State Analysis
- ✅ `ConversationType` enum exists: `'general' | 'case-study'`
- ✅ `Conversation` interface has `type: ConversationType` field
- ✅ `ConversationSummary` interface has `type: ConversationType` field
- ✅ ConversationList.tsx is already filtering by conversation type (expecting it to work)
- ❌ `createNewConversation` function doesn't accept or set the `type` parameter
- ❌ `getConversationSummaries` doesn't return the `type` field
- ❌ No localStorage migration for existing conversations without `type` field

## Usage Analysis
Current calls to `createNewConversation`:
1. **Case creation**: Lines 256, 370, 410 in FlowiseChatWindow.tsx - Should be 'case-study' type
2. **General conversations**: Lines 317, 410 in FlowiseChatWindow.tsx - Should be 'general' type
3. **ConversationList**: Line 96 - Should be 'general' type (default)

## Tasks to Complete

### 1. Update createNewConversation Function
- [x] Add `type?: ConversationType` parameter to function signature
- [x] Set default type to 'general' if not provided
- [x] Assign the type field when creating new conversations
- [x] Update function interface in ChatContextType

### 2. Update getConversationSummaries Function
- [x] Include the `type` field in the returned summaries
- [x] Ensure it matches the ConversationSummary interface

### 3. Implement localStorage Migration
- [x] Add migration logic in `loadConversations` function
- [x] Set default type to 'general' for existing conversations without type
- [x] Update version number to trigger migration
- [x] Ensure backward compatibility

### 4. Update Function Calls
- [x] Find all calls to `createNewConversation` and update them to pass type when needed
- [x] Ensure case-study conversations are created with the correct type

## Expected Behavior After Implementation
- New conversations can be created with specific types
- Existing conversations get migrated to have 'general' type by default
- Case-study conversations are properly typed when created from case management
- Conversation summaries include the type information for UI filtering

## Files to Modify
- `/src/contexts/ChatContext.tsx` - Main implementation
- Search for calls to `createNewConversation` across the codebase

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Only adding missing functionality, not changing existing behavior
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing data will be migrated with sensible defaults
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality remains intact

## Review - Implementation Complete ✅

### Changes Made

#### 1. ChatContext.tsx Updates
- **Import**: Added `ConversationType` import
- **Interface**: Updated `createNewConversation` function signature to include `type?: ConversationType`
- **Interface**: Updated `getConversationSummaries` return type to include `type: ConversationType`
- **Implementation**: Enhanced `createNewConversation` function with:
  - Smart type detection: `caseId` → 'case-study', default → 'general'
  - Added `caseId` assignment to new conversations
  - Added `type` field to new conversation objects
- **Implementation**: Updated `getConversationSummaries` to return `type` field with fallback to 'general'
- **Migration**: Added localStorage migration in `loadConversations`:
  - Detects version < 1.1 or missing version
  - Automatically assigns types to existing conversations
  - Saves migrated data back to localStorage
- **Versioning**: Updated all localStorage operations to version '1.1'

#### 2. Intelligent Type Assignment
The implementation includes smart defaults:
- **Case Study**: Any conversation with a `caseId` gets 'case-study' type
- **General**: All other conversations get 'general' type
- **Explicit**: Developers can explicitly pass type parameter when needed

#### 3. Backward Compatibility
- Existing conversations without `type` field are automatically migrated
- Migration is transparent and happens once per user
- No data loss or corruption during migration
- Falls back to 'general' type for any edge cases

### Testing Status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Build process completed without errors
- ✅ All interfaces properly typed
- ✅ Migration logic implemented and tested

### Impact
- **ConversationList.tsx**: Will now properly filter conversations by type
- **Case Management**: Case-related conversations are properly categorized
- **UI Components**: Can now distinguish between conversation types for better UX
- **Data Integrity**: All existing conversations maintain their functionality while gaining type classification

### Next Steps
The implementation is complete and ready for use. The conversation type system is now fully functional with:
- Automatic type assignment for new conversations
- Migration for existing conversations
- Proper TypeScript support
- Backward compatibility maintained
