# MediMind Expert: Complete Calculator Translation System PRD

## Overview
This PRD outlines the systematic translation of all medical calculators in the MediMind Expert platform to support English, Russian, and Georgian languages. Building on the successful translation methodology established for TIMI, GRACE, and Atrial Fibrillation calculators, this project will complete the internationalization of 30+ professional medical calculators across Cardiology and OB/GYN specialties.

**Problem Statement:** Medical professionals in Georgian and Russian-speaking regions need access to clinically validated calculators in their native languages to ensure accurate patient care and reduce medical errors from language barriers.

**Target Users:** Medical professionals (cardiologists, obstetricians, gynecologists) practicing in multilingual environments, particularly in Georgia, Russia, and other regions where these languages are prevalent.

**Value Proposition:** Complete medical calculator platform with 100% validated accuracy available in three languages, enabling seamless clinical decision-making across diverse healthcare environments.
