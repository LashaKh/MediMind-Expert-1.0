- **Root Cause:** Calculator service missing implementation for endometrial cancer risk calculation
- **Solution:** Complete calculateEndometrialCancerRisk function with evidence-based medical accuracy
- **Integration:** Full OB/GYN calculator service dispatcher and validation system integration

**Critical Implementation Patterns:**
```typescript
// OB/GYN Calculator Service Integration Pattern
function calculateEndometrialCancerRisk(input: EndometrialCancerRiskInput): EndometrialCancerRiskResult {
  // Evidence-based lifetime risk calculation (2.8% baseline)
  // BMI-specific risk multipliers (up to 5-6x for severe obesity)
  // Lynch syndrome high-risk identification (40-60% lifetime risk)
  // Comprehensive risk factor assessment with clinical guidelines
  // Professional medical recommendations with screening protocols
}

// Service Dispatcher Integration Pattern
export function calculateOBGYN(calculatorType: OBGYNCalculatorType, input: OBGYNCalculatorInput) {
  switch (calculatorType) {
    case 'endometrial-cancer-risk':
      return calculateEndometrialCancerRisk(input as EndometrialCancerRiskInput);
    // Additional calculator cases...
  }
}

// Input Validation Integration Pattern
export function validateOBGYNInput(calculatorType: OBGYNCalculatorType, input: OBGYNCalculatorInput) {
  switch (calculatorType) {
    case 'endometrial-cancer-risk':
      // Age validation (18-100), BMI validation (15-60), risk factor validation
      break;
  }
}
```
