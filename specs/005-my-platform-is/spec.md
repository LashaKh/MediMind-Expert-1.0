## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A cardiologist with a 5-year-old laptop (Intel Core i3, 4GB RAM, integrated graphics) opens MediMind Expert. The platform should load smoothly within 5 seconds, allow seamless navigation between calculators and AI chat, and maintain responsiveness during medical data entryall without the laptop overheating or slowing down other applications.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a low-end PC (4GB RAM, dual-core CPU), **When** user opens MediMind Expert for the first time, **Then** the platform MUST load the login page within 3 seconds and the main dashboard within 5 seconds on a 3G connection

2. **Given** user is actively using medical calculators, **When** user switches between different calculator types (GRACE, TIMI, CHA2DS2-VASc), **Then** each calculator MUST render within 500ms without lag or screen freezing

3. **Given** user has the Georgian transcription interface open, **When** user starts voice recording, **Then** recording MUST start within 200ms and maintain real-time transcription without CPU spikes above 40%

4. **Given** user is running background applications (EMR system, browser with 10+ tabs), **When** user interacts with MediMind Expert, **Then** platform MUST remain responsive with <200ms input latency and <30% CPU usage

5. **Given** user leaves platform open for 4+ hours, **When** user returns to interact with the platform, **Then** platform MUST maintain responsiveness without requiring page refresh, and memory usage MUST NOT exceed 150MB

6. **Given** user has slow internet (3G or unstable connection), **When** user navigates between features, **Then** platform MUST show cached content immediately and load new data progressively without blocking the UI

### Edge Cases
- **What happens when** PC has only 2GB RAM available? ’ Platform MUST detect low memory and disable non-critical features (animations, real-time analytics) while maintaining core medical functionality
- **What happens when** integrated graphics driver is outdated? ’ Platform MUST fallback to CSS-only animations (no GPU transforms) without visual degradation
- **What happens when** user opens 50+ tabs/sessions simultaneously? ’ Platform MUST throttle background processes and prioritize active tab rendering
- **What happens when** PC overheats (thermal throttling)? ’ Platform MUST reduce animation frequency, disable real-time subscriptions, and show performance mode indicator
- **How does system handle** sudden CPU spikes from other applications? ’ Platform MUST detect resource contention and queue non-critical operations
