# Performance Optimization API Contracts

This directory contains OpenAPI specifications for performance monitoring, bundle optimization validation, component optimization tracking, and device detection APIs.

## Contract Files

1. **performance-monitoring.yaml**: Web Vitals and resource usage metrics API
2. **bundle-optimization.yaml**: Bundle size analysis and validation API
3. **component-optimization.yaml**: React component performance profiling API
4. **device-detection.yaml**: Device capability detection and performance mode API

## Contract Testing

All contracts include failing tests (no implementation yet) to be implemented following TDD approach:

```bash
# Run contract tests
npm run test:contract

# Expected: All tests FAIL (red phase of TDD)
```

## Implementation Order

1. Performance monitoring contracts (Phase 3, Task 15-18)
2. Device detection contracts (Phase 3, Task 19-22)
3. Component optimization contracts (Phase 3, Task 23-26)
4. Bundle optimization contracts (Phase 3, Task 27-30)

See `../plan.md` Phase 2 for detailed task breakdown.
