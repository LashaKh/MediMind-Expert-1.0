# Tasks: Form 100 Generation for ER Consultation Reports

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-form-100-generation/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → ✅ React 18.3.1 + TypeScript, Zustand, Tailwind CSS, Supabase
2. Load optional design documents:
   → ✅ data-model.md: DiagnosisCode, DiagnosisCategory, Form100Request entities
   → ✅ contracts/: form100-api.yaml, flowise-integration.yaml
   → ✅ research.md: Component integration strategy, voice recording reuse
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → ✅ Setup: TypeScript interfaces, service layer, component structure
   → ✅ Tests: Contract tests, component tests, integration tests
   → ✅ Core: Components, hooks, services, configurations
   → ✅ Integration: MedicalAnalysisCard extension, voice recording
   → ✅ Polish: Mobile optimization, error handling, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → ✅ Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → ✅ Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → ✅ Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

# T021 runs alone (will be modified later in integration)
Task: "Implement Form100Modal component in src/components/Form100/Form100Modal.tsx"
```

## Medical Safety & Compliance Notes

### Evidence-Based Validation Requirements
- **T017**: Diagnosis configuration must use validated ICD-10 codes with published medical literature references
- **T022**: Dropdown options must match exact medical terminology from clinical guidelines
- **T042**: Form 100 content must comply with Georgian medical documentation standards

### Performance Requirements  
- **T031**: Voice recording integration must maintain <200ms start time (constitutional requirement)
- **T043**: Form 100 generation must complete within 5 seconds for optimal clinical workflow
- **T036-T039**: Mobile optimization must maintain 44px touch targets for medical professional use

### Security & Privacy Requirements
- **T044**: All Form 100 data transmission must be HIPAA-compliant with secure authentication
- **T031**: Voice recording must maintain session isolation to prevent transcript contamination
- **T018**: Service layer must implement proper error handling without exposing patient data

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked before task execution*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T005-T007 cover form100-api.yaml, flowise-integration.yaml)
- [x] All entities have model tasks (T016-T017 cover DiagnosisCode, DiagnosisCategory, Form100Request)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T005-T015 before T016-T044)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (verified file paths, no overlapping modifications)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path (all tasks include full paths)
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task (sequential tasks identified and marked)

## Notes
- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **Sequential tasks** = same file modifications, must run in order
- **TDD Enforcement**: All tests (T005-T015) must be written and FAIL before any implementation
- **Medical Compliance**: Form 100 generation follows evidence-based medical documentation standards
- **Performance**: Voice recording maintains constitutional <200ms requirement through useGeorgianTTS reuse
- **Mobile-First**: All components optimized for touch interaction with 44px minimum targets
