# Phase 0: Research & Technical Analysis

## Feature Context Analysis

### Existing Georgian TTS Integration
**Decision**: Reuse existing `useGeorgianTTS` hook from `/src/hooks/useGeorgianTTS.ts`  
**Rationale**: The hook already provides optimized voice recording with <200ms start time, session isolation, and real-time transcription capabilities that match our Form 100 requirements  
**Alternatives considered**: Creating new voice recording system (rejected due to code duplication and loss of performance optimizations)

### Current Report Card Architecture
**Decision**: Extend `MedicalAnalysisCard` component with Form 100 button  
**Rationale**: Analysis shows existing diagnosis detection logic in `getAnalysisType()` function already identifies I24.9, I26.0, and I50.0 reports, providing perfect integration point  
**Alternatives considered**: Separate component (rejected due to UI consistency needs), Modal overlay (rejected due to workflow disruption)

### Voice Transcription Implementation Pattern
**Decision**: Use existing voice instruction pattern from report editing system  
**Rationale**: `ReportEditCard` already implements voice input with microphone UI and real-time feedback that users are familiar with  
**Alternatives considered**: Custom voice interface (rejected due to UX consistency requirements)

### Flowise Endpoint Integration Strategy
**Decision**: Create service layer following existing patterns in codebase  
**Rationale**: Consistent with existing API service patterns, enables proper error handling and mock endpoint switching  
**Alternatives considered**: Direct API calls from components (rejected due to separation of concerns)

## Technical Stack Validation

### Component Architecture
**Decision**: Feature-based organization under `/src/components/Form100/`  
**Rationale**: Follows established codebase pattern for complex features like Georgian transcription system  
**Alternatives considered**: Single file component (rejected due to complexity), Mixed integration (rejected due to maintainability)

### State Management Strategy
**Decision**: Local component state with props drilling for Form 100 generation flow  
**Rationale**: Feature is scoped to single user interaction flow, doesn't require global state complexity  
**Alternatives considered**: Zustand store (rejected due to over-engineering), Context API (rejected due to limited scope)

### UI Component Library
**Decision**: Extend existing `MedicalDesignSystem` components  
**Rationale**: Maintains visual consistency and touch target requirements (≥44px) already implemented  
**Alternatives considered**: Custom components (rejected due to design system deviation)

### Mobile-First Implementation
**Decision**: Follow existing responsive patterns in Georgian transcription components  
**Rationale**: Mobile components already implement touch-friendly recording interfaces and safe area support  
**Alternatives considered**: Desktop-first approach (rejected due to constitutional mobile-first requirement)

## Integration Points Analysis

### Diagnosis Detection Logic
**Location**: `src/components/Georgian/components/MedicalAnalysisCard.tsx:66-80`  
**Current Implementation**: `getAnalysisType()` function with hardcoded diagnosis patterns  
**Extension Required**: Add Form 100 button display logic for identified diagnosis types

### Voice Recording Interface
**Location**: Voice instruction pattern in `ReportEditCard` component  
**Current Implementation**: Microphone button with real-time feedback and transcript display  
**Reuse Pattern**: Extract reusable voice input component for Form 100 transcript field

### API Service Layer
**Pattern**: Follow existing service organization in `/src/lib/` directory  
**Integration**: Create `form100Service.ts` with Flowise endpoint management and mock handling

## Performance & Compliance Analysis

### Constitutional Compliance Check
- ✅ Touch targets ≥44px: Extend existing `MedicalButton` components  
- ✅ <200ms recording start: Reuse optimized `useGeorgianTTS` hook  
- ✅ Session isolation: Leverage existing session ID patterns  
- ✅ HIPAA compliance: Follow existing Row Level Security patterns  
- ✅ TDD approach: Build on existing test patterns in Georgian components

### Mobile Performance Requirements
**Current**: Georgian TTS achieves <200ms start through microphone pre-initialization  
**Form 100**: Voice transcript field will inherit same performance characteristics  
**Validation**: No additional performance optimizations required

## Data Flow Architecture

### Input Data Sources
1. **ER Consultation Report**: Existing `ProcessingHistory.aiResponse` field
2. **Selected Diagnosis**: New dropdown selection state  
3. **Doctor Transcript**: Voice input using `useGeorgianTTS` hook
4. **Angiography Report**: Text input field

### Output Processing
1. **Live Endpoint**: I20.0 diagnosis → `https://flowise-2-0.onrender.com/api/v1/prediction/6dc8bb6d-ce79-4a40-9561-9108ba05e7c7`
2. **Mock Endpoints**: All other diagnoses → placeholder API responses
3. **Form 100 Content**: Generated medical form document for display/download

## Component Hierarchy Design

```
MedicalAnalysisCard (existing)
├── Form100Button (new)
    └── Form100Modal (new)
        ├── DiagnosisDropdown (new)  
        ├── VoiceTranscriptField (new, reuses useGeorgianTTS)
        ├── AngiographyReportField (new)
        └── GenerateForm100Button (new)
```

**Integration Point**: Add Form 100 button to existing card action buttons (Copy, Download, Share)  
**Modal Pattern**: Follow existing modal patterns in template creation system  
**Voice Component**: Extract and adapt voice input from report editing system

## Testing Strategy Alignment

### Component Testing
**Pattern**: Follow existing test structure in `/src/components/Georgian/components/__tests__/`  
**Coverage**: Each new component requires unit tests with React Testing Library  
**Voice Testing**: Mock `useGeorgianTTS` hook for predictable test outcomes

### Integration Testing  
**E2E Flows**: Complete Form 100 generation workflow from report card to final document  
**API Testing**: Mock Flowise endpoints for reliable test execution  
**Responsive Testing**: Validate touch interactions at mobile breakpoints

### Medical Accuracy Validation
**Diagnosis Mapping**: Validate ICD-10 code to dropdown option mappings  
**Data Integrity**: Ensure ER report content preservation through Form 100 generation  
**Regulatory Compliance**: Verify Form 100 structure meets medical documentation standards

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Areas
- Voice transcription integration (proven technology stack)
- UI component integration (established design system)
- Mobile responsiveness (existing patterns)

### Medium Risk Areas  
- Flowise endpoint reliability (external dependency)
- Complex multi-step modal workflow (user experience)
- Diagnosis-specific logic maintenance (multiple condition types)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Mock endpoint fallbacks for development/testing
- Clear progress indicators and error states
- Centralized diagnosis configuration for easy updates
