# Implementation Plan: Form 100 Generation for ER Consultation Reports

**Branch**: `004-form-100-generation` | **Date**: 2025-09-30 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-form-100-generation/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Form 100 generation feature for ER consultation reports with diagnosis-specific dropdown selection, voice transcript input using existing transcription system, angiography report fields, and Flowise endpoint integration. The feature extends existing ER report cards with standardized medical form generation capability for regulatory compliance and clinical continuity.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: React 18.3.1 with TypeScript (strict mode)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Zustand, Tailwind CSS, Supabase client, existing Georgian TTS service  
**Storage**: Supabase PostgreSQL with Row Level Security  
**Testing**: Vitest with React Testing Library, Playwright for E2E  
**Target Platform**: Web application (mobile-first responsive)  
**Project Type**: web - extends existing React frontend with new components  
**Performance Goals**: <200ms transcription start, real-time voice processing  
**Constraints**: Touch targets ≥44px, HIPAA compliance, session isolation  
**Scale/Scope**: Extends existing ER report system, ~5-10 new components

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Medical Safety & Compliance**: ✅ PASS
- Form 100 generation follows evidence-based medical documentation standards
- ICD-10 diagnosis codes properly validated and mapped
- Medical content reviewed for clinical accuracy
- Regulatory compliance maintained for medical forms

**Mobile-First Medical Interface**: ✅ PASS
- Extends existing MedicalDesignSystem with 44px+ touch targets
- Modal workflow optimized for mobile medical professionals
- Voice recording interface maintains mobile-first approach
- Progressive enhancement from existing responsive patterns

**Performance & Reliability**: ✅ PASS
- Reuses optimized useGeorgianTTS hook maintaining <200ms recording start
- Session isolation preserved through existing session ID patterns
- Real-time voice transcription maintains constitutional performance requirements
- Flowise integration includes proper error handling and retry mechanisms

**Security & Privacy**: ✅ PASS
- Leverages existing Row Level Security for all data operations
- No additional patient data persistence beyond existing patterns
- HIPAA-compliant session management through existing architecture
- Secure transmission to external Flowise endpoints with proper authentication

**Testing & Validation (TDD Mandatory)**: ✅ PASS
- Comprehensive test scenarios defined in quickstart.md
- Contract tests specified for all API endpoints
- Component tests required for each new UI element
- Integration tests cover complete Form 100 generation workflow
- Mock endpoints enable reliable testing independent of external services

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - extends existing React frontend with new components in feature-based organization

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No constitutional violations identified. All design decisions align with established medical safety, mobile-first interface, performance, security, and testing requirements.


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
