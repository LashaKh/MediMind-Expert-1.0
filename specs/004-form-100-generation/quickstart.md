**Step 2: Initiate Form 100 Generation**  
```
1. Click the "Generate Form 100" button on the report card
2. Verify modal opens with diagnosis selection dropdown
3. Confirm dropdown contains 6 diagnosis options for I24.9 category
4. Select "I20.0 - არასტაბილური სტენოკარდია Braunwald III Troponin +"
```

**Expected Result**: Modal advances to input fields step with voice transcript and angiography fields visible

**Step 3: Add Voice Transcript**
```
1. Click microphone button in "Doctor Transcript" field
2. Record 10-15 seconds of additional clinical notes
3. Wait for transcription to complete
4. Verify transcript text appears in field
5. Optionally edit transcript text manually
```

**Expected Result**: Voice recording starts within 200ms, transcript appears in real-time, manual editing works correctly

**Step 4: Add Angiography Report**
```
1. Click in "Angiography Report" text field
2. Enter sample angiography findings:
   "Coronary angiography reveals 80% stenosis in LAD, 50% stenosis in RCA, normal LCx"
3. Verify text formatting and character count
```

**Expected Result**: Text field accepts input, displays character count, maintains formatting

**Step 5: Generate Form 100**
```
1. Click "Generate Form 100" button
2. Observe loading state with progress indicator
3. Wait for processing to complete (should be <5 seconds)
4. Verify Form 100 content appears in modal
5. Check that content includes ER report, selected diagnosis, transcript, and angiography data
```

**Expected Result**: Live Flowise endpoint processes request successfully, generates comprehensive Form 100 document

**Step 6: Form 100 Actions**
```
1. Copy Form 100 content to clipboard
2. Download Form 100 as text/PDF file
3. Share Form 100 via available sharing options
4. Close modal and verify original report unchanged
```

**Expected Result**: All action buttons work correctly, original ER report remains intact

### Test Scenario 2: Mock Endpoint Testing (I21.4 - Mock Response)

**Step 1: Select Mock Diagnosis**
```
1. Open Form 100 modal on I24.9 report
2. Select "I21.4 - მიოკარდიუმის მწვავე სუბენდოკარდიული ინფარქტი"
3. Add minimal transcript and angiography data
4. Generate Form 100
```

**Expected Result**: Mock endpoint returns placeholder Form 100 content with clear mock indicator

### Test Scenario 3: Different Primary Diagnosis Categories

**Step 1: Heart Failure Report (I50.0)**
```
1. Locate ER report with I50.0/heart failure diagnosis
2. Click "Generate Form 100" button
3. Verify dropdown shows heart failure-specific diagnosis options
4. Test mock generation workflow
```

**Expected Result**: Category-specific diagnosis list displayed, mock generation works

**Step 2: Pulmonary Embolism Report (I26.0)**
```
1. Locate ER report with I26.0/pulmonary embolism diagnosis  
2. Click "Generate Form 100" button
3. Verify dropdown shows PE-specific diagnosis options
4. Test mock generation workflow
```

**Expected Result**: PE-specific diagnosis list displayed, mock generation works

### Test Scenario 4: Error Handling

**Step 1: Network Error Simulation**
```
1. Disconnect internet or block Flowise endpoint
2. Attempt Form 100 generation with I20.0 diagnosis
3. Verify error message displays
4. Test retry functionality
5. Reconnect network and retry
```

**Expected Result**: Clear error messaging, retry option available, recovery works when network restored

**Step 2: Validation Errors**
```
1. Attempt to generate Form 100 without selecting diagnosis
2. Try with empty ER report content
3. Test with invalid session ID
```

**Expected Result**: Validation errors prevent submission, clear error messages displayed

### Test Scenario 5: Mobile Responsiveness

**Step 1: Mobile Device Testing**
```
1. Open on mobile device or resize browser to 320px width
2. Navigate to ER report and click "Generate Form 100"
3. Test all modal interactions on touch screen
4. Verify voice recording works on mobile
5. Test typing in angiography field with mobile keyboard
```

**Expected Result**: All interactions work on mobile, touch targets ≥44px, keyboard doesn't break layout

### Performance Validation

**Metric 1: Voice Recording Start Time**
- Target: <200ms from button click to recording start
- Measure: Time from microphone button tap to recording indicator

**Metric 2: Form 100 Generation Time**  
- Target: <5 seconds for live endpoint response
- Measure: Time from "Generate" button click to content display

**Metric 3: Mobile UI Responsiveness**
- Target: All interactions complete within 100ms
- Measure: Button press to visual feedback delay

### Integration Validation

**System Integration Check**
```
1. Verify Form 100 feature doesn't affect existing report editing
2. Confirm voice recording doesn't interfere with other TTS sessions
3. Test multiple Form 100 generations in sequence
4. Validate session isolation between different reports
```

**Expected Result**: No conflicts with existing functionality, proper session management

### Security & Privacy Validation

**Data Protection Check**
```
1. Verify no patient data logged to browser console
2. Confirm voice recordings not persisted locally
3. Test that different users cannot access each other's Form 100 data
4. Validate secure transmission to Flowise endpoints
```

**Expected Result**: HIPAA compliance maintained, no data leakage, secure transmission

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

**Voice Recording Not Starting**
- Check browser microphone permissions
- Verify no other applications using microphone
- Test with different browser/device
