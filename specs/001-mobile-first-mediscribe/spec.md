## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Medical professionals using mobile devices need to transcribe patient consultations without viewport disruption or keyboard interference. When they tap the transcript text area to edit content, the header navigation must remain visible and accessible, while the footer recording controls must dynamically adjust above the mobile keyboard to remain functional.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a medical professional opens MediScribe on mobile device, **When** they tap the transcript text area to edit, **Then** the header remains fixed and visible without viewport shift
2. **Given** the mobile keyboard appears after tapping textarea, **When** the keyboard is displayed, **Then** the recording/upload buttons move above the keyboard and remain accessible
3. **Given** the user is editing transcript text, **When** they scroll within the text area, **Then** the cursor remains visible without browser auto-scrolling the entire page
4. **Given** the user finishes editing, **When** they dismiss the keyboard, **Then** the layout returns to original state with footer buttons in default position
5. **Given** the user switches between recording and editing, **When** they interact with controls, **Then** all functionality works seamlessly without layout disruption

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user rotates device while keyboard is active?
- How does system handle rapid switching between text editing and recording?
- What occurs when user attempts to scroll while keyboard is displayed?
- How does layout respond to different mobile keyboard heights?
- What happens with accessibility tools like voice control or magnification?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain fixed header position during text area focus without viewport shifting
- **FR-002**: System MUST dynamically reposition footer controls above mobile keyboard when text editing is active
- **FR-003**: System MUST prevent browser auto-scroll behavior when cursor is positioned in text area
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain touch target accessibility standards (minimum 44px) for all interactive elements
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve all existing transcription functionality while implementing mobile optimizations
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle keyboard height changes dynamically across different mobile devices and orientations
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide smooth transitions between keyboard states without jarring layout shifts
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain recording/upload button accessibility when mobile keyboard is active
- **FR-009**: System MUST support seamless editing of transcript content without interrupting ongoing recording sessions
- **FR-010**: System MUST preserve scroll position and text cursor location during keyboard show/hide transitions

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: Layout adjustments MUST complete within 100ms of keyboard state changes
- **PR-002**: Text area responsiveness MUST maintain sub-50ms input latency during editing
- **PR-003**: Viewport height calculations MUST update within 16ms to maintain 60fps transitions

### Accessibility Requirements
- **AR-001**: System MUST maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for touch targets and contrast ratios
- **AR-002**: System MUST support screen readers and voice control during mobile keyboard interactions
- **AR-003**: System MUST provide clear visual feedback for focus states on mobile devices
- **AR-004**: System MUST ensure keyboard navigation remains functional alongside touch interactions

### Key Entities
- **Mobile Viewport State**: Represents current screen dimensions, keyboard height, and orientation
- **Transcript Session**: Contains editable medical transcript content with cursor position tracking
- **Keyboard Event Handler**: Manages keyboard show/hide events and layout adjustments
- **Dynamic Layout Container**: Responsive container that adjusts to keyboard presence
- **Touch Interface Controller**: Manages touch interactions and gesture handling for mobile devices
