# Feature Specification: MediScribe Interactive Report Editing

**Feature Branch**: `002-on-my-generated`  
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "on. my generated report section on mediscribe page. I want small nice text area of manual text or voice instruction input, based on which already generated report will be updated. so basically user text or voice isntruction will be sent to the same flowise endpoint that has generated the report in the first place. for voice text transcription you must use same tts flow that we are using when user selects first Fast option of voice transcription. basically thatmenas that we are not specifcing the TTS model. check how thing are working in my text tarnscription and do exactly same. Plus i want the generated report to be editable so user can do some manual addits alongsie those autmatic edit request with tts coomand or text written instructions. so basically when we expand the generated report card on the button there must be text input arrea fro each generated report, and based on the instructions those reports must be changed"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature: Interactive editing for MediScribe generated reports
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Healthcare professionals using MediScribe
   ’ Actions: Edit reports via text/voice, manual editing capability
   ’ Data: Generated medical reports, edit instructions, updated reports
   ’ Constraints: Use existing TTS flow, same Flowise endpoint
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ All requirements clearly defined by user
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear user flow: expand report ’ input text/voice ’ process via AI ’ update report
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement is testable and aligned with medical workflow
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Medical reports, edit instructions, voice transcripts
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No implementation details, focused on user value
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a healthcare professional using MediScribe, I want to refine and edit automatically generated medical reports through both text instructions and voice commands, so that I can quickly customize reports to match specific patient cases and clinical findings without starting from scratch.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has generated a medical report (e.g., Heart Failure ER Report I50.0), **When** they expand the report card, **Then** they see an editable text area and an instruction input field with voice/text options
2. **Given** a user enters text instructions like "add patient complained of shortness of breath for 3 days", **When** they submit the instruction, **Then** the report is updated with the new information while maintaining medical formatting and accuracy
3. **Given** a user selects voice input and speaks instructions, **When** they complete the voice instruction, **Then** their speech is transcribed using the Fast TTS option and automatically processed to update the report
4. **Given** a user manually edits the report text directly, **When** they save changes, **Then** the report is updated with both manual edits and maintains version history
5. **Given** a user makes multiple edit requests, **When** they review the updated report, **Then** all changes are coherently integrated without conflicting information

### Edge Cases
- What happens when voice transcription fails or produces unclear instructions?
- How does the system handle conflicting information between manual edits and AI-generated updates?
- What occurs if the Flowise endpoint is unavailable during an edit request?
- How does the system manage concurrent edits to the same report?
- What happens when edit instructions are medically contradictory to existing report content?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an expandable interface for each generated medical report showing both the report content and editing options
- **FR-002**: System MUST offer dual input methods for report modifications: direct text instructions and voice-based instructions
- **FR-003**: System MUST use the existing Fast TTS transcription flow (STT3 model) for voice instruction processing without requiring model specification
- **FR-004**: System MUST send edit instructions to the same Flowise endpoint that generated the original report to maintain consistency and context
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow direct manual editing of report text alongside AI-assisted modifications
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve medical formatting, terminology, and clinical accuracy when processing edit instructions
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide real-time feedback during voice transcription and AI processing of edit requests
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain version history and show clear indicators of what content has been modified
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate that edit instructions are medically coherent with existing report content
- **FR-010**: System MUST support multiple sequential edit operations on the same report without losing previous modifications
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide clear success/error feedback for each edit operation with medical context
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain the original report structure (sections, medical codes, formatting) while incorporating new information

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Medical Report**: Generated diagnostic reports with medical codes (I50.0, I24.9), clinical assessments, timestamps, and processing metadata
- **Edit Instruction**: User-provided text or transcribed voice commands for report modification, including instruction type and processing timestamp
- **Voice Transcript**: Transcribed speech from healthcare professionals using the Fast TTS option, processed for medical terminology
- **Report Version**: Historical states of medical reports showing original content, modifications, and edit timestamps for audit trail
- **Edit Session**: Complete editing workflow including original report, all modifications, user interactions, and final updated report state
