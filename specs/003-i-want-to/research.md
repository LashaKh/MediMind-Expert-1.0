# Research Analysis: Custom Report Templates for MediScribe

## Unknowns Resolved

Based on the feature specification analysis and existing codebase examination, here are the research findings for unclear aspects:

### Template Management Capabilities

**Decision**: Support Create, Read, Update, Delete operations  
**Rationale**: Users need full CRUD capabilities to manage their templates effectively. Medical professionals often refine their documentation approach over time.  
**Alternatives considered**: Read-only after creation was rejected because it limits iterative improvement of templates.

### Template Sharing vs Privacy Settings

**Decision**: Private templates only (per-user)  
**Rationale**: Medical templates may contain institution-specific formats and privacy considerations. Initial implementation focuses on individual customization.  
**Alternatives considered**: Shared templates rejected for initial version due to HIPAA complexity and approval workflows needed.

### Template Validation Rules

**Decision**: 
- Name: 2-100 characters, unique per user, alphanumeric + spaces + medical symbols
- Example structure: 10-50,000 characters (generous limit for comprehensive examples)
- Notes: 0-10,000 characters (optional guidance)

**Rationale**: Medical templates can be quite detailed. Conservative limits prevent abuse while allowing comprehensive examples.  
**Alternatives considered**: Shorter limits rejected because medical documentation requires detailed formatting.

### Maximum Templates Per User

**Decision**: 50 templates per user  
**Rationale**: Sufficient for specialty-specific customization without overwhelming the interface. Prevents system abuse.  
**Alternatives considered**: Unlimited was rejected due to performance and UI organization concerns.

### Template Organization Features

**Decision**: Simple chronological listing with search functionality  
**Rationale**: Keeps initial implementation simple while providing essential discoverability.  
**Alternatives considered**: Categories and tags deferred to future iterations based on user feedback.

### Version Control and Change Tracking

**Decision**: Simple update timestamps, no version history  
**Rationale**: Medical templates are typically refined rather than reverted. Keeping implementation simple for MVP.  
**Alternatives considered**: Full version history rejected due to complexity and questionable medical workflow value.

## Technology Integration Research

### Existing Flowise Integration

**Current Implementation**: 
- `src/services/diagnosisFlowiseService.ts` handles AI requests
- Supports file attachments and context enhancement
- Uses specialty-aware routing for Cardiology vs OB/GYN

**Integration Approach**: 
- Extend existing prompt construction to include template structure and notes
- Maintain backward compatibility with current prompt format
- Add template selection parameter to request flow

### Database Schema Requirements

**Current Supabase Setup**:
- `profiles` table with user management and Row Level Security
- `georgian_sessions` for transcription data with user isolation
- Established pattern for user-specific data with RLS

**New Schema Needs**:
- `user_report_templates` table with user_id foreign key
- RLS policies for user data isolation
- Indexes for efficient template retrieval and search

### UI Integration with Existing Templates Page

**Current Structure**: 
- `PremiumTemplatesSection.tsx` displays "Cardiologist Consults" section
- Card-based layout with gradient styling
- Search and filter functionality already implemented
- Mobile-responsive design with touch-friendly targets

**Integration Strategy**:
- Add "My Templates" section above existing "Cardiologist Consults"
- Reuse existing card styling and interaction patterns
- Extend search functionality to include custom templates
- Modal-based creation interface for consistency

## Best Practices Research

### React Form Management

**Decision**: React Hook Form with Zod validation  
**Rationale**: Already used in the project, provides robust validation and type safety  
**Alternatives considered**: Direct state management rejected due to complexity of form validation

### State Management for Templates

**Decision**: Zustand store for template state  
**Rationale**: Consistent with existing state management patterns, supports real-time updates  
**Alternatives considered**: React Context rejected due to performance implications with frequent updates

### Mobile-First Design Patterns

**Decision**: Modal popup with responsive sizing and touch-friendly controls  
**Rationale**: Follows existing design patterns, ensures 44px touch targets per constitution  
**Alternatives considered**: Inline editing rejected due to space constraints on mobile devices

## Performance Considerations

### Template Loading Strategy

**Decision**: Eager loading of user templates on page mount  
**Rationale**: Small dataset per user (max 50), immediate availability enhances UX  
**Alternatives considered**: Lazy loading rejected due to simple use case and small data size

### Search Performance

**Decision**: Client-side search for templates, server-side search for template content  
**Rationale**: Template metadata is small enough for client-side filtering, content search may need full-text capabilities  
**Alternatives considered**: Full server-side search deferred pending performance analysis

## Security Analysis

### Data Protection

**Decision**: Follow existing RLS patterns with user-specific data isolation  
**Rationale**: Consistent with HIPAA compliance requirements and established security model  
**Alternatives considered**: Additional encryption rejected as unnecessary given Supabase's security model

### Input Sanitization

**Decision**: Zod schema validation + DOMPurify for template content  
**Rationale**: Prevents XSS while allowing medical formatting in templates  
**Alternatives considered**: Plain text only rejected due to reduced utility for formatting examples

## Research Conclusions

All NEEDS CLARIFICATION items from the specification have been resolved with evidence-based decisions that:

1. Maintain consistency with existing codebase patterns
2. Follow medical software best practices for safety and privacy
3. Support the constitutional requirements for mobile-first design and performance
4. Provide a foundation for iterative improvement based on user feedback

The feature is ready for Phase 1 design with clear technical direction and resolved ambiguities.
