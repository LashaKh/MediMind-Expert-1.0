## Narrative

Dr. Sarah Chen uploads a complex 45-page cardiology guidelines document that she needs to absorb before her next rotation. Instead of the previous system that might miss crucial implementation details or skip entire subsections, the enhanced pipeline comprehensively analyzes the entire document structure. The system identifies all 12 major sections and 34 subsections, creating a detailed outline that she can review and modify. As each section's script is generated, she can see exactly which parts of the original document are being covered, with quality indicators showing 98% content coverage. The resulting podcast maintains the logical flow of the original guidelines while ensuring no critical clinical recommendations are omitted. During her commute, she can confidently listen knowing that she's receiving complete coverage of the source material, with proper citations and medical context preserved throughout.
